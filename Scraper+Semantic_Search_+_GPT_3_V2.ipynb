       "  \"Over time, the Retirement Funds' mix of investment allocations (equities, fixed income and money market funds) will change based on a predetermined strategy. Generally, except for the Retirement Income Fund, the more time that remains until a target-date Retirement Fund approaches its target retirement date, the more emphasis that Fund will place on achieving capital appreciation by investing more heavily in equity funds.\",\n",
       "  'Alternatively, the less time that remains until a target-date Retirement Fund approaches its target retirement date, the more emphasis that Fund will place on preserving capital while also seeking to produce income, by investing more in fixed income and short-term investments.',\n",
       "  'As each target-date Retirement Fund approaches its target retirement year, Mutual of America Capital Management LLC, the Adviser, will periodically reallocate and change the mix of Mutual of America Capital Management LLC Funds to gradually move toward an objective of capital preservation and income production.',\n",
       "  \"Unlike the target-date Retirement Funds, the mix of investments in the Retirement Income Fund is not expected to change over time. The Retirement Income Fund is intended for investors who have passed their retirement date and seek a mix of investments more geared toward the objective of preserving capital and producing income than that offered by other Retirement Funds. From the period of time remaining until a Retirement Fund's target retirement date, current market conditions, the economy, unanticipated events and other factors may affect the periodic reallocation of each Retirement Fund's assets.\",\n",
       "  'The Retirement Funds are expected to be rebalanced periodically, approximately on a quarterly basis. The mix of Funds within each Retirement Fund is expected to be reviewed at least annually.',\n",
       "  'Many investors can expect to live for a significant time period after retirement. Although capital preservation becomes a primary consideration in retirement, growth is also an important consideration to help offset the negative impact of inflation.',\n",

       "  'This year, six nonprofit organizations were selected for their outstanding contributions to society in partnership with public, private and other social sector organizations. This includes the winner of a newly created award in honor of Frances R. Hesselbein, a Presidential Medal of Freedom recipient and esteemed retired member of the Company’s Board of Directors, who was part of the Mutual of America family for more than 40 years and passed away on December 11, 2022. Her knowledge, understanding and deep connection to the nonprofit social welfare sector led to the creation of the Mutual of America Community Partnership Award.',\n",
       "  '“The 2022 award-winning programs have created innovative solutions that effectively address challenging social, emotional and physical issues being faced by many individuals and families in their local communities across the country,“ said Lisa M.

       "  'The Thomas J. Moran Award is given to the national award-winning program and includes $100,000 and a documentary video about the program. This year’s recipient, the Patriot PAWS Prison Training Program, was established in 2008 by Patriot PAWS Service Dogs (Rockwall, TX), which is dedicated to training and providing service dogs of the highest quality at no cost to disabled American veterans and others with mobility disabilities.',\n",
       "  'The Frances R. Hesselbein Award is given to a partnership that is addressing social challenges in more than one community, or which demonstrates the potential to be replicated in other communities. This year’s recipient, the Child Advocate Program, was established in 2004 by The Young Center for Immigrant Children’s Rights (Chicago, IL), and will receive $50,000.',\n",
       "  'Four other organizations were named honorable mention recipients for their programs, and each will receive $50,000. They are: Give Items of Value Program (United Way of the Plains, Wichita, KS); Neighborhood Vacancy Initiative (Legal Aid Services of Eastern Missouri, St. Louis, MO); Safer Tomorrows Road Map (Community Violence Intervention Center, Grand Forks, ND); and Work and Life Skills Training Program (Wildflyer Coffee, Minneapolis, MN).',\n",

       "  'RMD age requirement pushed back.\\xa0The age at which participants must begin taking distributions from their retirement accounts rose from age 72 to 73, beginning January 1, 2023, and will jump to age 75 by 2033. Additionally, the new legislation reduces the penalty for failure to take RMDs on time from 50% to 25% and, in some cases, 10%.',\n",
       "  'New option for employer matching contributions.\\xa0Starting in 2024, the new law will allow employers to match student loan payments (up to applicable contribution limits) and deposit those funds in employee retirement accounts, as if the student loan repayments were deferrals to a retirement plan.',\n",
       "  'Mandatory automatic enrollment and auto escalation.\\xa0Employers launching a new 401(k) or 403(b) plan in 2025 or after will be required to auto enroll eligible employees as plan participants at a 3%–10% default rate (employees can opt out). These contributions must increase 1% each year, up to at least 10%.',\n",
       "  'Increased access for part-time workers.\\xa0Starting in 2025, part-time employees will be eligible to participate in their employer’s 401(k) or 403(b) plan after they work at least 500 hours per year for two consecutive years of service. Employees who work at least 1,000 hours must generally be included after one year of service.',\n",
       "  'Bigger “catch-up” contributions for older participants.\\xa0Beginning in 2024, all catch-up contributions made by participants with annual compensation of $145,000 or more must be made on an after-tax Roth basis. And starting in 2025, the SECURE 2.0 Act will increase the catch-up amount that employees aged 60 to 63 can contribute to $10,000 or 150% of the regular catch-up amount for those age 50 and older, whichever is greater.',\n",
       "  'The SECURE 2.0 Act of 2022 includes dozens of retirement plan-related provisions—some that are required, others than are optional—including those related to emergency savings, 401(k) emergency withdrawals, an employer match for Roth accounts and more. Find out more in our January issue of Plan Sponsor Bulletin. We will keep you informed of guidance from the IRS and DOL on how these new rules can or should be implemented.',\n",

       "  'A retirement account is a great way to save for your future, but once you reach a certain age, the IRS requires that you start withdrawing a percentage of your assets from your 401(k), 403(b) and other types of tax-deferred retirement accounts each year. This is known as the Required Minimum Distribution, usually referred to as an RMD for short. Note: RMDs apply to traditional IRAs, but they do not apply to Roth IRAs because contributions are made with income that has already been taxed.',\n",
       "  'What types of retirement plans do RMD rules apply to?',\n",
       "  'Past: The SECURE Act of 2019 changed the RMD rules to increase the age for the required beginning date for RMDs from age 70½ to age 72, applicable to participants who reach age 70½ on or after January 1, 2020.',\n",
       "  'Present: The SECURE 2.0 Act of 2022 increases the age for the required beginning date for RMDs still further, to age 73, as of January 1, 2023.',\n",
       "  'Future: In ten years, the RMD age will rise yet again to 75.',\n",
       "  'The amount changes each year. The IRS uses a formula for determining the amount of your RMD, which divides the total of all your tax-deferred retirement savings accounts by your life expectancy. If you’ve reached the mandatory age for making withdrawals, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) makes available a calculator\\xa0to determine how much money you need to take out of your 401(k) or traditional IRA.',\n",
       "  'What if I have more than one tax-deferred savings account?',\n",
       "  'If you have more than one IRA or more than one 403(b) account, you must calculate the RMD for each IRA or account separately each year. However, you may aggregate your RMD amounts for all your IRAs and all your 403(b)s and withdraw the total from one IRA or 403(b) account. Alternatively, you can withdraw a portion from each of your IRAs or each of your 403(b) accounts.',\n",
       "  'If you have more than one defined contribution plan, you must calculate and withdraw your RMDs separately for each plan.',\n",
       "  'If you reach age 72 in 2022, you need to make your first RMD withdrawal by April 1, 2023, and an additional withdrawal by December 31, 2023, of each subsequent year.',\n",
       "  'If you reach age 72 in 2023, you need to make your first RMD withdrawal by April 1, 2025, and an additional withdrawal by December 31, 2025, of each subsequent year.',\n",
       "  'Mistakes happen, but if you miss the RMD deadline, you could be liable for a 25% penalty tax based on the amount owed.',\n",
       "  'If you correct the error in a timely manner, the penalty tax is reduced to 10%. In order to make the correction and pay the excise tax, you will need to file IRS Form 5329 with an accompanying check to cover the payment.',\n",
       "  'As an alternative, you might consider requesting a waiver. The IRS may waive the penalty if you made what the IRS considers a “reasonable error” that caused you to miss the RMD payment deadline or underpay what you owed. To make your request, return IRS Form 5329 with a letter explaining why you believe you qualify, including the steps you have taken to rectify the error. You will be notified by the IRS about its decision to grant or deny your request. Note: No payment is required when making the waiver request.',\n",

       "  '2022 was a turbulent year for both the equity and bond markets. For the first time in the last 40 years, the stock and bond markets both declined by double-digit percentage points. The S&P 500® Index finished the year down 18.1%. This is just its third annual decline since the Global Financial Crisis 14 years ago, and a painful reversal for investors after the S&P 500 gained nearly 27% in 2021. In the last four decades, only 2002 and 2008 were worse than 2022. All told, the Index lost $8.2 trillion in value, according to the S&P Dow Jones Indices. The Nasdaq composite, with a heavy concentration in growth companies, suffered an even bigger loss of 32.5%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average posted a 6.9% loss for 2022.',\n",
       "  'The markets struggled all year as inflation hit a 40-year high, prompting the U.S. Federal Reserve to embark on its most aggressive tightening cycle in decades. Central banks raised interest rates at a historic pace not seen since the 1980s to fight high inflation. The Fed’s aggressive rate hikes remain a major focus for investors, as the central bank walks a thin line between raising rates enough to slow the economy, but not so much that its actions push the economy into a recession.',\n",
       "  'At the beginning of 2022, the Fed’s key lending rate stood at a range of 0% to 0.25% before it raised rates seven times to close the year at a range of 4.25% to 4.5%. Currently, the Fed is forecasting that rates will reach 5.0% to 5.25% by the end of 2023. Additionally, its forecast does not call for a rate cut before 2024.',\n",
       "  'Meanwhile, ongoing supply-chain issues, combined with Russia’s continuing invasion of Ukraine, worsened inflationary pressures as prices spiked for oil, gas and food commodities. Oil closed the year at $80 per barrel, about $5 higher than where it started the year; however, oil jumped to a high of $123.70 a barrel during the year, which helped energy post the only gain among the 11 sectors in the S&P 500 during 2022.',\n",
       "  'A different concern was China, which spent most of the year imposing strict COVID-19 policies, slowing demand for raw materials and goods. Recently, its government began lifting travel and other restrictions. It is unclear what the impact will be on the world economy as China tries to reopen its own economy in 2023.',\n",
       "  'The Fed’s battle with inflation will likely remain the most important issue for both Wall Street and Main Street in 2023. Investors will continue to focus on whether inflation is easing and if the Fed can guide the economy to a soft landing.',\n",
       "  'Mutual of America Capital Management LLC believes that volatility will remain elevated during the first half of 2023. The major issues that we are watching include the Federal Reserve’s ability to tame inflation and avoid a recession, the job market, corporate earnings and the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine.',\n",
       "  'The S&P 500 and the Dow posted strong results in the fourth quarter, with gains of 7.5% and 16.0%, respectively. International markets were particularly strong, as a weaker U.S. dollar in the quarter helped the MSCI EAFE Index return 17.3% during this period. Even with a robust fourth quarter, equity markets only modestly diminished losses for the full year.',\n",
       "  'As noted above, for the full year, the S&P 500 declined 18.1%, the Nasdaq slumped 32.5%, and the Dow fell 6.9%. During the same period, the Russell 1000® Value Index (down 7.6%) outperformed the Russell 1000® Growth Index (down 29.1%) by 21.5%. Given that higher interest rates make future earnings less valuable, it was not surprising to see the value sector continue to outperform the growth sector among large-cap and small-cap equities.',\n",
       "  'In 2022, the U.S. bond market suffered its worst year on record, with bond indices down anywhere from 5% to 30%, depending on credit quality and maturity. The Fed lifted interest rates an astonishing 400 basis points, one of the fastest and most aggressive rate-hike cycles in history. This was in an effort to combat inflation, which peaked in June at 9.1%, its highest rate since the early 1980s. As Edward McQuarrie, professor emeritus at Santa Clara University, said, “Inflation is, in short, kryptonite for bonds.”',\n",
       "  'For the year, interest rates across the Treasury yield curve increased anywhere from 206 to 457 basis points. The projected pace of monetary tightening, along with hawkish rhetoric from the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), has induced a flattening of the yield curve. The spread between 2-year Treasury and 10-year Treasury yields narrowed by 181 basis points, creating an inverted yield curve of 55 basis points. Sometimes, this can be a precursor for potential economic weakness. On December 14, in the Fed’s ongoing quest to bring down inflation running near its highest levels since the 1980s, the central bank approved its seventh rate hike of the year and its second consecutive 0.50-percentage-point rate hike, bringing the Federal Funds Rate up to a range of 4.25% to\\xa04.50%.',\n",
       "  'In 2022, the 10-year Treasury rose 237 basis points, to 3.88%, after finishing 2021 at 1.51%. With interest rates rising aggressively, bond prices fell during the same period. The 10-year Treasury fell 16.3%, the 30-year Treasury declined 33.5%, the Bloomberg U.S. Corporate Bond Index fell 15.8%, and the Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Index declined 13.0%. It’s worth noting that bonds finished in both 2022 and 2021 with negative returns; it is extremely unusual for bonds to have negative returns in back-to-back years. The last time that happened was in 1958 and 1959.',\n",
       "  'One silver lining in the fixed income market is that yields on bonds, in absolute terms, are the highest they have been since the Global Financial Crisis. Looking at the U.S. Treasury yield curve, the 2-year note is yielding 4.43%; at the start of 2021, the same instrument was yielding 0.73%. In other words, there is more income in fixed income than we have seen in quite some time.',\n",
       "  'Taking a closer look at inflation, it continues to be problematic in the U.S., and its persistent rise is caused by a variety of factors. These include increases in global commodities, ongoing consumer demand, wage pressures for employers, and lingering supply-chain issues. The December readings for all three well-known inflation gauges continued to show levels well over the Fed’s average target of 2.0%: 1) The Bureau of Economic Affairs’ Core Personal Consumption Expenditures, the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge, was up 4.4% year over year; 2) the Producer Price Index, which sometimes predicts the direction of consumer prices, was up 6.8%; and 3) the Consumer Price Index (CPI), the most widely recognized gauge, was up 6.5%. The CPI provides a statistical measure of the average change in prices in a fixed-market basket of consumer goods and services. The December CPI marked the 21st consecutive month that inflation was above the Fed’s target rate.',\n",
       "  'There are segments of the economy that have begun to show signs of lower prices as interest rates have risen, which should help ease inflation during 2023. The most visible area is a slowdown in commodity prices—especially gasoline, which was in a downward trend since peaking in June above $5. At the end of the year, the national average was $3.32 per gallon, slightly below the price a year ago of $3.40.',\n",
       "  'Looking at housing, existing home sales have stalled, and are down for 10 consecutive months and 35% below levels from a year ago, according to the National Association of Realtors. Existing median single-family homes peaked in June and have been down for five consecutive months. Mortgage rates are the leading cause of the sluggishness in housing. During 2022, the 30-year fixed mortgage rate started 2022 at 3.1% and rose to a peak of 7.1% before backing off to 6.4%.',\n",
       "  'The ISM manufacturing index or purchasing managers’ index is considered another key indicator of the state of the economy, as it measures the amount of ordering activity at the nation’s factories. The first reading in 2022 was 58.8 and, by December, it had weakened considerably, contracting by almost 10 points to 49.0.',\n",
       "  'In other areas, such as shipping and the automotive sector, sales have started to fall as well. Shipping rates have tumbled as consumer demand for goods has softened. The World Container Index, compiled by Drewry Shipping Consultants, was down 77% in 2022. A combination of higher prices, limited supply and higher financing costs has slowed new vehicle sales. For the full-year 2022, auto sales are projected at 8% lower than 2021 sales and 20% lower than their peak in 2016.',\n",
       "  'The Fed is laser-focused on lowering inflation to its 2% target, and to do so, it must tighten monetary policy enough to create slack in the labor market. The nonfarm payroll report for December 2022 contained evidence that the labor market is cooling to a degree, but there is still work to be done. December’s change in nonfarm payrolls came in at 223,000, which was slightly above the consensus estimate, but considerably less than the previous 12-month average of 375,000. Fed officials were most likely encouraged to see average hourly earnings on an annual basis drop to 4.6%, from 4.8%. Going in the other direction, the overall unemployment rate dropped to 3.5% at the end of 2022 and dropped to 3.4% in January, which represents a 50-year low. Even with historic rate increases over the course of 2022, the labor market is still too tight from the Fed’s perspective, which means that the Fed will need to continue to raise interest rates, though at a slower pace and with modest increases compared to 2022, and proceed with quantitative tightening as 2023 progresses.',\n",
       "  'Looking at the demand side, the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) for December showed that the number of job openings nationwide was 11 million. This is an indication that the labor market is tight, with a greater supply of jobs than demand for jobs. The Fed is trying to avoid wage-price spiral inflation, in which higher wages will eventually be passed on to consumers from companies needing to pay more to workers. A key to taming inflation is for the Fed to slow the job market, but to do so in a controlled way so that the unemployment rate does not spike meaningfully.',\n",
       "  'Since the beginning of 2022, the Fed switched from what had been an extraordinarily accommodative monetary policy to a hawkish stance. This more aggressive position was reaffirmed in August at the Jackson Hole Economic Policy Symposium. The Fed hiked interest rates at seven straight meetings in 2022, making it the most active Fed since 2005. The U.S. central bank current forecasts show rates will reach 5.0% to 5.25% by the end of 2023 and do not call for a rate cut before 2024. With the Fed’s more aggressive stance on tightening monetary policy to combat inflation, it is more likely that the economy will contract and employers will pull back hiring in response. When the Fed first spoke about bringing prices down, it had hoped to achieve a soft landing and not induce a recession.',\n",
       "  'Estimates for the balance of 2022 indicated that the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) will show modest growth, ending the year at 1.9%. Economists’ forecasts for 2023 now expect the GDP to show only modest growth of 0.5%, and these forecasts predict a 65% chance that the U.S. economy will enter a recession during 2023.',\n",
       "  'One of the consequences of raising interest rates to fight inflation is that the U.S. dollar has soared, relative to other currencies. According to Bloomberg’s Dollar Spot Index, the dollar strengthened 8.2% during 2022, peaking on September 27 at $114.106. The majority of the dollar’s move upward occurred between June and November, when the Fed raised rates by 75 basis points at four consecutive meetings. The dollar’s strength, relative to other currencies, puts financial pressure on other countries around the world, increasing the cost of imports priced in dollars and of servicing dollar-denominated debts. This is particularly difficult for emerging countries that have accumulated large quantities of dollar-denominated debt in recent years. Another consequence of a strong dollar is that it hurts U.S. multinational corporations that need to exchange their international sales back into dollars. Within the S&P 500, approximately 29% of sales come from non-U.S. countries. This will be a drag on earnings for these companies and could lead to lower earnings expectations.',\n",
       "  'The revaluation of equities is a function of high inflation and the Fed’s aggressive response to lower inflation by slowing the economy. As a result, investors are requiring a substantially higher risk premium due to higher interest rates and heightened economic uncertainty. Higher rates are causing equities’ price-to-earnings (P/E) multiples to contract, as future cash flows are less valuable when discounted to their present value. This is especially true for longer-duration assets such as growth companies. This rising interest-rate environment prompted investors to sell their high-priced shares of technology giants, such as Apple and Microsoft, as well as of other companies that flourished as the economy recovered from the pandemic. Amazon and Netflix each lost roughly 50% of their value, and Tesla and Meta Platforms each dropped by more than 60%. As a result, growth stocks have experienced a significant reduction in their P/E multiples. During 2022, the forward multiple on the S&P 500 Index contracted from 21.4 times at the start of the year to 17.6 times by the end of the year. During the same time frame, the 100 most expensive stocks fell from 43.0 times to 30.5 times, and the next 400 stocks fell from 17.2 times to 14.6 times.',\n",
       "  'While equity prices have fallen in 2022, it appears that valuations are beginning to price in the outlook for the economy. Domestic small-cap stocks appear most attractive, as they trade below both their historic P/E multiples and large-cap stocks multiples. The Russell 2000 has not traded at this low of a relative valuation to the S&P 500 since the early 2000s. As a comparison, the Russell 2000 outperformed the S&P 500 by more than 50% over the five years (2002–07) after the dot-com bubble in the early 2000s.',\n",
       "  'While 2022 was a difficult year for investors, it did help flush out some speculative excesses. SPACs, so-called meme stocks and “zombie” companies, all got wiped out. Notably, the crypto markets plummeted from $3 trillion in value to less than $1 trillion.',\n",
       "  'The financial markets continued to experience downward swings in prices due to the heightened level of uncertainty in 2022. As a result, the overall short-to-intermediate outlook remains uncertain, and there are several issues impacting the markets and economy worth keeping an eye on through 2023. Perhaps most crucial will be actions taken by the Federal Reserve, which appears committed to continuing to raise interest rates to lower inflation.',\n",
       "  'At the moment, higher interest rates are starting to work their way into the economy. On the positive side, the impact of these higher interest rates are showing, with reduced prices and costs in areas ranging from gasoline to commodities, to auto sales and the housing market. On the negative side, inflation continues at levels not seen in decades, and continues to have a significant impact on persistently high food prices and wages, and increased medical costs. Additionally, the labor market is still too tight, from the Fed’s perspective.',\n",
       "  'With all of this in mind, the Fed clearly recognizes that inflation is a major problem, and it is expected to use all the tools in its arsenal to cool the economy and engineer a soft landing, while avoiding a recession. We will continue to monitor this and other important issues that might impact our outlook in the coming months.',\n",

       "  'Equity investors began the third quarter of 2022 with renewed optimism that the worst of the volatility in the financial markets was behind them and pushed the S&P 500® Index up 9.2% in July. This boost turned out to be a “bear market rally,” as equities sagged with the reality that inflation remained elevated, and the U.S. Federal Reserve was going to remain diligent in its pursuit to tame it. The S&P 500 declined 4.1% in August and 9.2% during September—with the latter marking its worst showing for that month since 2002. As a result, the third quarter ended at new lows for the year. For the quarter, the S&P 500 (down 4.9%) and the Nasdaq (down 3.9%) completed their first three-quarter losing streak since 2009. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (Dow) declined 6.2% for the same period and saw its third consecutive losing quarter for the first time since 2015. Both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq ended the quarter firmly in “bear market” territory, down 23.9% and 32.0%, respectively.',\n",
       "  'Some key market-moving events during the quarter included Fed Chairman Jerome Powell’s hawkish speech in August at the Jackson Hole Economic Policy Symposium, the surprising increases in core and headline inflation in September, and the revised Implied Fed Funds Target Rates dot plot released at the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) September meeting, which suggests Fed officials are now forecasting higher rates.

The Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Index declined 4.3% in September and 4.8% for the third quarter, and was down 14.6% for the year-to-date period. The popular investment strategy of maintaining a portfolio with 60% equities and 40% bonds is experiencing its worst year since 1920, with returns down 27%. Historically, it is unusual for both equities and bonds to be down simultaneously.',\n",
       "  'Even commodities declined in the third quarter. After nine consecutive quarters of increases, West Texas Intermediate oil prices declined by 24.8% and ended below $80 a barrel (though they moved above that level again in October). Copper was down 8.1%, and gold fell 3.4%. The one bright spot was the U.S. dollar, which continued to strengthen and was up 3.8% in the quarter.',\n",
       "  'As noted in prior issues of Economic & Market Perspective, the volatility in the market is a result of uncertainty, and that certainly remains the case. Mutual of America Capital Management LLC continues to believe that volatility will remain elevated in the fourth quarter and into 2023. The major issues that we are watching include: the Federal Reserve’s ability to tame inflation and avoid a recession, the midterm elections, the U.S. dollar’s strength, and the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine.',\n",
       "  'Given the elevated levels of uncertainty, most stocks struggled during the first nine months of 2022. As noted above, year to date through September 30, the S&P 500 declined 23.9% and the Nasdaq slumped 32.0%, while the Dow fell 19.7%. During the same period, the Russell 1000® Value Index (down 17.8%) outperformed the Russell 1000® Growth Index (down 30.7%) by 12.9%. Given that higher interest rates make future earnings less valuable, it was not surprising to see the value sector continue to outperform the growth sector among large-cap and small-cap equities, as was the case in the first quarter.',\n",
       "  'As we pointed out in the April issue of the Economic & Market Perspective, interest rates have been trending downward since the early 1980s, meaning that bond prices have been in a prolonged “bull market.” This bull market trend is continuing to reverse in 2022, as a host of crosscurrents are making for a volatile year in the U.S. bond market. Year to date through September 30, interest rates across the Treasury yield curve increased anywhere from 187 to 372 basis points. This dramatic move comes in the wake of historically high inflation and the Fed’s pledge to combat higher prices with a series of rate hikes and balance-sheet normalization. The projected pace of monetary tightening, along with hawkish rhetoric from the FOMC, has induced a flattening of the yield curve. The spread between 2-year Treasury and 10-year Treasury yields narrowed by 123 basis points, creating an inverted yield curve of 45 basis points. Sometimes, this can be a precursor for potential economic weakness. On September 21, in the Fed’s quest to bring down inflation running near its highest levels since the 1980s, the central bank approved its third consecutive 0.75-percentage-point rate hike, bringing the Federal Funds Rate up to a range of 3.0% to 3.25%.',\n",
       "  'Year to date through the end of the third quarter, the 10-year Treasury rose 232 basis points to 3.83% after finishing 2021 at 1.51%. With interest rates rising aggressively, bond prices fell during the same period. The 10-year Treasury was down 16.8%, the 30-year Treasury declined 31.5%, the Bloomberg U.S. Corporate Bond Index fell 18.7%, and the Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Index declined 14.6%. Although this data reflects just the first nine months of 2022, it’s worth noting that bonds finished 2021 with a negative return, and it is extremely unusual for bonds to have negative returns in back-to-back years. The last time this happened was in 1956.',\n",
       "  'Taking a closer look at inflation, it continues to be problematic in the U.S., and its persistent rise is caused by a variety of factors. These include increases in global commodities, ongoing consumer demand, wage pressures for employers, and lingering supply-chain issues. In September, all three well-known inflation gauges continued to show levels well over the Fed’s average target of 2.0%. 1) The Bureau of Economic Affairs’ Core Personal Consumption Expenditures, the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge, was up 4.9% year over year; 2) the Producer Price Index, which sometimes predicts the direction of consumer prices, was up 8.5%; and 3) the Consumer Price Index (CPI), the most widely recognized gauge, was up 8.2%—which continued to be a multidecade high. The CPI provides a statistical measure of the average change in prices in a fixed-market basket of consumer goods and services. The September CPI marked the 18th consecutive month that inflation was above the Fed’s target rate.',\n",
       "  'The ongoing effect of inflation is apparent in many areas of the economy and continues to directly impact consumers’ purchasing power. A major contributor to inflationary pressures has been food prices. The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) Economic Research Service updated its August report, which indicated that food prices continue to rise. Economy-wide factors, including ongoing supply-chain issues, as well as energy, transportation and labor costs, have contributed to increases in prices across all food categories. USDA forecasts for consumer food price inflation were increased again in August, with all food prices up 0.8%. Year over year, they are up 11.4%, and at-home prices (i.e., groceries) are up 13.5% through August. By far, the largest increase has been in retail egg prices, which were up 2.9% in August 2022 and 39.8% higher than last August. This increase is due in part to a significant reduction in egg supplies as a result of an ongoing outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), which has affected over 44 million birds.',\n",
       "  'At the same time, labor costs have also escalated sharply. The Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta estimates that hourly workers who switched jobs in the last three months received a median pay raise of 8.4%. More importantly, average hourly earnings are up 5.2% year over year. This is not surprising given the high demand for labor and the low supply of workers available.',\n",
       "  'With the strongest labor market in the last 50 years, the Fed is finding it challenging to bring down inflation. New job creation has been resilient this year, with consistently more than 250,000 individuals being added to payrolls monthly. Between July and September, employers added an average of 371,000 jobs, and the unemployment rate ended the quarter at 3.5%—below the pre-pandemic level and matching the 50-year low. Employment now exceeds its pre-pandemic level and stands at just shy of 160 million people.',\n",
       "  'Looking at the demand side, the Bureau of Labor Statistics Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) for August showed that the number of job openings nationwide was 10 million. This is an indication that the labor market is tight, with a greater supply of jobs than demand. Adding all this together, this is beginning to look and feel like wage-price spiral inflation, where these higher wages will eventually be passed on to consumers from companies needing to pay more to workers. A key to taming inflation is for the Fed to slow the job market, but it must do so in a controlled way, so that the unemployment rate does not spike meaningfully.',\n",
       "  'There are segments of the economy that have begun to show signs of lower prices as interest rates have risen, and these should help ease inflation heading into 2023. The most visible area is a slowdown in commodity prices—especially gasoline, which was in a downward trend since peaking in July at $5.00 per gallon. Through October 3, the national average was $3.82 per gallon. While that price is off the July high, it is still elevated relative to the price a year ago, $3.27. It is also interesting to note that there are considerable differences in prices across the country. As of October 3, the price in California is $5.38, while the price in Texas is $3.19.',\n",
       "  'One reason the price has declined from its highs in July is the release of one million barrels of oil per day from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to help to cut gas prices and fight inflation. To date, the reserve has been reduced from 726 million barrels to 450 million barrels—a level not seen since 1984. At some point in the future, the U.S. will need to refill the reserve, which could put upward pressure on the price of gasoline. On the international front, OPEC+ announced on October 5 that it would cut production by one million barrels a day. While that’s viewed as a positive for Saudi Arabia and Russia to keep prices elevated, this move further adds to the challenges faced by countries across the globe, including the U.S., in the outlook for the energy market. As a result, after this announcement, gas prices across the country began to rise again.',\n",
       "  'In addition to oil, prices of the following major commodities softened year to date, ending September 2022: aluminum (-22%), copper (-22%), silver (-18%), sugar (-2%) and cotton (-17%).',\n",
       "  'The second area of slowing trends is automobile sales. A combination of higher prices, limited supply and higher financing costs have slowed new vehicle sales to an expected 13.5 million annually. This compares to pre-pandemic annual sales of 17 million vehicles.',\n",
       "  'In addition, housing has slowed, as it has a direct correlation with higher interest rates. As of September 30, U.S. mortgage rates had risen nearly 1.4% since July, as Treasury yields rose in response to the Fed’s intensified inflation fight. As of October 10, the 30-year fixed mortgage rate was 6.81%, which marked a 16-year high. To put this in perspective, the monthly mortgage payment for an average home costing $375,000, after a 20% down payment, was $1,600 in January 2022. As of September 30, a mortgage on that same house would be $2,550, an increase of $950 per month. Other indications of a slowing housing market are the Mortgage Bankers Association’s measure of national mortgage loan applications, which dropped 2.1% to 170.5 through October 3, the lowest level since 2015; and the gauge of potential refinancing activity, which dropped to 1.8%, a 22-year low.',\n",
       "  'Since the beginning of 2022, the Fed has switched from what had been an extraordinarily accommodative monetary policy to a hawkish stance. This more aggressive position was reaffirmed in August at the Jackson Hole Economic Policy Symposium. The Fed has hiked interest rates at five straight meetings this year, making it the most active Fed since 2005. But focusing on only the number of moves underestimates just how aggressive they have been. In its latest move in September, the Fed raised interest rates by three-quarters of a point for the third straight time. After this move, the Fed Funds Rates sits at 3.0% to 3.25%—the highest since 2008 after sitting near zero through March of 2022. It is also interesting to note that the Fed has not raised rates by three percentage points in a single year since the 1980s.',\n",
       "  'In an updated projection, the Fed signaled plans to lift rates by another 1.25 percentage points before the year is over, potentially bringing the federal funds rate to 4.25% to 4.50% before the end of the year. Considering that the Fed only has two meetings left, that could mean another 0.75-basis-point hike in November, followed by a half-point increase in December.',\n",
       "  'With the Fed’s more aggressive stance on tightening monetary policy to combat stubborn inflation, it is now more likely that the economy contracts and employers pull back hiring in response. When the Fed first spoke about bringing prices down, it had hoped to achieve a soft landing and not induce a recession. More recently, the markets are worried that the Fed will overachieve its objective and tighten too much. Even Chairman Powell noted in his speech on August 26, “While higher interest rates, slower growth and softer labor market conditions will bring down inflation, they will also bring some pain to households and businesses. These are the unfortunate costs of reducing inflation. But a failure to restore price stability would mean far greater pain.” We can assume from his comments that pain is synonymous with recession. According to an October survey by The Wall Street Journal, economists put the probability of a recession within the next 12 months at 63%, up from 49% in a similar survey conducted in July.',\n",
       "  'Forecasts include that the U.S. economy will enter a recession next year. Estimates for the balance of the year indicated that the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) will show only modest growth, ending the year at 1.7%. However, economists’ forecasts for 2023 are becoming increasingly murky. They now expect the GDP to contract in both the first and second quarters of 2023—which is a downgrade from the last quarterly survey conducted by Bloomberg, which showed modest growth.',\n",
       "  'One of the consequences of raising interest rates to fight inflation is that the U.S. dollar has soared relative to other currencies. The Wall Street Journal Dollar Index, which measures the dollar against a basket of other currencies, is up approximately 16% this year through September 30. The dollar’s strength relative to other currencies puts financial pressure on other countries around the world, increasing the cost of imports priced in dollars and servicing dollar-denominated debts. This is particularly difficult for emerging countries that have accumulated large quantities of dollar-denominated debt in recent years. In addition, many of these same countries import much of their fuel, food and other commodities in dollars. Another consequence of a strong dollar is that it hurts U.S. multinational corporations that need to exchange their international sales back into dollars. Within the S&P 500, approximately 29% of sales come from non-U.S. countries. There will be a drag on earnings for these companies, which could lead to lower earnings expectations.',\n",
       "  'The downward revaluation of equities is a function of high inflation and the Fed’s aggressive response to try to lower inflation by slowing the economy. As a result, investors are requiring a substantially higher risk premium due to higher interest rates and heightened economic uncertainty. Higher rates are causing equities’ price-to-earnings (P/E) multiples to contract, as future cash flows are less valuable when discounted to their present value. This is especially true for longer-duration assets such as growth companies. Growth stocks have experienced a significant reduction in their P/E multiples. The 2023 forward multiple on the S&P 500 Index has contracted, from 21.5 times at the start of the year to 15 times today.',\n",
       "  'Over the past decade, investors were introduced to the acronym TINA (There Is No Alternative). It is best characterized by an extremely low-yield environment where bonds are unattractive and “there is no alternative” to equities. As a result of the rising interest rates this year, it appears that TINA may not be a long-term investment strategy. While equity prices have fallen significantly in 2022, it appears that valuations are beginning to price in the outlook for the economy. Domestic small-cap stocks appear most attractive as they trade below both their historic P/E multiples and large-cap stock multiples. International stocks have also declined, but the economic outlook in Europe is more challenging than in the U.S.',\n",
       "  'The financial markets continued to experience downward swings in prices due to the heightened level of uncertainty over the first nine months of 2022. As a result, the overall short-to-intermediate-term outlook remains uncertain, and there are several issues impacting the markets and economy that are worth keeping an eye on through the balance of this year. One certain thing is that the Federal Reserve is committed to continuing to raise interest rates to lower inflation.',\n",
       "  'At the moment, higher interest rates are starting to work their way into the economy. On the positive side, the impact of these higher interest rates is showing, with affected areas so far including the prices of gasoline and commodities, auto sales and the housing market. On the negative side, inflation continues at levels not seen in decades, and continues to have a significant impact on food prices, wages and medical costs.',\n",
       "  'With all of this in mind, the Fed clearly recognizes that inflation is a major problem, and it is expected to use all the tools in its arsenal to cool the economy and engineer a soft landing while avoiding a recession. We will continue to monitor this, and other important issues that might impact our outlook, in the coming months.',\n",

       "  'Given recent upheavals in the banking sector, we sat down with Jerry H. Tempelman—who covers financial institutions as a Vice President and Fixed Income Analyst for Mutual of America Capital Management LLC—to get insights into what’s going on and how it’s affecting financial markets.',\n",
       "  'Mutual of America: A few prominent banks have failed recently—Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank, Credit Suisse. Is this the start of a global financial crisis?',\n",
       "  'Jerry Tempelman: The current environment is not shaping up to be like the global financial crisis of 2008, which was far more widespread than what we’re seeing today. The problems at the banks you mentioned were specific to significant issues that each of those individual banks faced. In general, banks fail because of problems in their loan portfolio. The global financial crisis was a good example of that. Back then, banks and other financial intermediaries extended too much credit to the housing sector, creating a financial bubble. When that bubble finally burst, many financial institutions that had credit exposure to the housing sector ended up in trouble themselves.',\n",
       "  'Mutual of America: So how are the issues for the failed banks different now?',\n",
       "  'Jerry Tempelman: Today’s problems are much more specific to each bank. Take, for example, Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), which had a fairly concentrated business, namely, providing financial services to venture capital-related businesses. In recent years, that industry has done well, and SVB found itself flush with deposits, much of which it invested in longer-dated Treasurys and other fixed income securities. The reasons for SVB’s failure are complex, but, in brief, when the Federal Reserve began raising interest rates last year in an effort to tame inflation, and the financial markets grew volatile, those businesses began drawing down their deposits at SVB to help finance their operations. SVB, in turn, had to sell some of its securities holdings, which had incurred losses due to the rise in interest rates, but ultimately, it was unable to meet the swiftly growing demand by depositors seeking their money.',\n",
       "  'Mutual of America: Could there be any spillover effects from these banks that might affect otherwise healthy banks?',\n",
       "  'Jerry Tempelman: Yes, but largely in an indirect way. Soon after it became apparent that depositors had lost confidence in SVB and were trying to withdraw their money, clients of some other regional banks, especially on the West Coast, began calling into question the financial health of their own banks. But the Federal Reserve stepped in and created a new lending facility so that banks could borrow from the Fed and meet the deposit outflows they may have been experiencing. Since then, the Fed has provided extra liquidity almost exclusively to banks headquartered in its San Francisco and New York districts, where SVB and Signature Bank were located. Outside of those two districts, the general public has not lost confidence in regional banks.',\n",
       "  'Mutual of America: The largest U.S. banks seem to have fared just fine this time around. Why is that?',\n",
       "  'Jerry Tempelman: The banking system, as a whole, is in much better shape today to endure a crisis than it was going into the 2008 financial crisis. In general, banks are better capitalized and more liquid, allowing them to continue lending to investors. They also have much better risk-management systems, and their operations are more diversified. As a result of these and other measures, most U.S. banks are in a much better position to face a financial crisis or recession than they were in the past.',\n",

       "  'The first quarter of 2023 proved to be a tumultuous period in the financial markets as investors closely monitored the Federal Reserve’s stance on inflation and interest rates. However, the interpretation of data by investors was often perplexing. Positive economic indicators sometimes led to higher yields and lower bond prices, due to fears of a more hawkish Fed, while weaker economic data brought optimism of a more accommodative Fed. In essence, good news was seen as bad, and bad news was seen as good. Market returns followed this pattern, seesawing as January brought hopes of a Fed rate hike pause, only to be followed by “higher for longer” expectations in February, and then slightly disappointing data and banking system turmoil in March.',\n",
       "  'Despite the volatility, stock and bond markets generally posted positive returns in the quarter, and commodities were the only segment to experience negative returns. This marked a reversal from the market environment of 2022, with growth stocks outperforming value stocks, large cap stocks outperforming small cap stocks, technology outperforming energy and Bitcoin outperforming traditional asset classes. The bond market also showed a turnaround, with bond prices rising and rates falling, even as the Fed implemented additional rate hikes.',\n",
       "  'Looking ahead, Mutual of America anticipates that market volatility will remain elevated throughout 2023, as short-term data and policymakers’ comments continue to drive market sentiment. The key issues we’re closely monitoring include the Fed’s ability to manage inflation and avoid a recession, job market conditions, corporate earnings and the overall health of the financial sector.',\n",
       "  'During the first quarter, all major equity indexes posted gains, with the S&P 500® Index rising by 7.5%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 0.9% and the Nasdaq composite jumping 17.1%. Notably, the technology-heavy Nasdaq outperformed the Dow by the widest margin since 2001. Mega-cap growth stocks, which have strong balance sheets and consistent revenue streams, benefited from lower interest rates and safe-haven characteristics, making them leaders in the first quarter amidst a low-growth economic environment. Interestingly, the 50 largest stocks in the S&P 500, known as the “Nifty 50,” returned 11.6%, while the remaining 450 companies returned only 2.3%.',\n",

The year-to-date gain in the Nasdaq 100 added more than $2.4 trillion to its market capitalization, bringing the total to $15.5 trillion, although still below its late-2021 peak of $20 trillion. Notable achievements included Apple and Microsoft regaining their $2 trillion market capitalizations, ending at $2.6 trillion and $2.0 trillion, respectively, by the end of the quarter. The biggest gainer on both the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 was Nvidia Corporation, with a staggering 90% increase, its largest quarterly gain since 2001. This rise reflects investor interest in artificial intelligence (AI), as Nvidia chips are utilized in various applications, such as chatbots and other technologies.',\n",

Recent readings from three well-known inflation gauges consistently show levels above the Fed’s average target of 2.0%.',\n",
       "  'During the first quarter, the Bureau of Economic Analysis’ Core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Index, which is the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge and excludes food and energy prices, fell by about 1%, but still remains elevated at 4.6%. The Producer Price Index (PPI), which is sometimes considered a predictor of consumer prices, rose 2.7%. And the widely recognized Consumer Price Index (CPI) increased by 5.0%. The CPI measures the average change in prices for a fixed-market basket of consumer goods and services. Notably, the March CPI report marked the 24th consecutive month that inflation remained above the Fed’s target rate.',\n",
       "  'Although there are indications that inflation may be moderating, the Core PCE Index remains elevated. This underscores the persistent message from the Fed that more efforts are needed to address inflationary pressures. The variety of factors contributing to inflation, coupled with the prolonged period of inflation above target, highlight the ongoing challenges in managing inflation in the U.S. economy.',\n",
       "  'In an effort to combat inflation, the Fed began aggressively raising interest rates one year ago in March 2022. So far, it has implemented a total increase of 4.75%, and the effects of these rate hikes are starting to impact the economy. However, it is important to note that interest rate policy is a blunt tool with long and uneven lags.',\n",
       "  'One area where the impact is most evident is in the housing market, as higher mortgage rates are starting to cause sluggishness. In 2022, the 30-year fixed mortgage rate began at 3.1% and peaked in November at 7.1%. By the end of March 2023, the rate was sitting at 6.3%.',\n",
       "  'Another key indicator of the state of the economy is the ISM Manufacturing Index, also known as the Purchasing Managers’ Index. The first reading in 2022 was 58.8, but by March 2023, it had significantly weakened, contracting by almost 12.5 points to 46.3, indicating a decline in ordering activity at the nation’s factories.',\n",
       "  'Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth also showed signs of slowing down, with the fourth quarter of 2022 ending at 2.6%, down from 3.2% in the third quarter. The Atlanta Fed’s predictive model, GDPNow, is forecasting GDP growth of 2.5% in the first quarter, but consensus estimates predict the economy will slow in the second, third and fourth quarters of the year, with projections for a 0.2% increase, a 0.6% decrease and a 0.2% increase, respectively.',\n",
       "  'When looking at equities, there has been a shift in the narrative from last year’s “multiple compression” story to concerns about a potential growth slowdown or even a growth recession for corporate earnings. In the fourth quarter of 2022, overall earnings for the S&P 500 declined 3.2%, and it is expected that they will drop by 4.6% in the first quarter of 2023. One factor contributing to this decline is the decrease in profit margins, which have fallen for six consecutive quarters. Despite healthy top-line revenue growth, rising costs have put pressure on margins, creating a squeeze.',\n",
       "  'Adding to the concerns, the price/earnings ratio for the S&P 500, as reported by FactSet, is currently at about 17.8 times, which is higher than the beginning of the year at 16.7 times and above the 25-year historic average of 16.8 times. This suggests that stocks are not cheap at the moment. The first quarter of 2023 has been a contrasting market environment compared to 2022, with notable reversals, such as Bitcoin’s 70% return and meme stocks like AMC and GameStop rising by 23% and 25%, respectively.',\n",
       "  'Just three months ago, the idea of three major regional U.S. banks failing would have been unthinkable to most investors. However, the unexpected downfall of Silicon Valley Bank, the largest of the three, marked the second-largest bank failure in U.S. history. The other two banks, Silvergate and Signature Bank, were lesser known and had significant deposits in cryptocurrencies. All three banks failed because they ineffectively managed their interest rate and liquidity risks, which led to a “run” on deposits that needed to be funded with investments that had become “underwater” due to the rapid rise in interest rates. This was yet another unintended consequence of the Federal Reserve’s aggressive interest rate hikes. In addition, First Republic was essentially rescued by its U.S. competitors after facing significant liquidity issues, and UBS took over failing rival Credit Suisse.',\n",
       "  'Despite this crisis, we believe that the overall condition of the banking system is better than it was during the 2008 financial crisis and should be able to withstand the impact. However, we anticipate some immediate consequences, including increased regulations on small and regional banks, tightened lending standards and a decrease in the total number of loans. In fact, in just two weeks ending on March 29, lending activity dropped by a staggering $105 billion, marking the largest decline in loan activity since 1973. While these changes were not planned by the Fed, they are expected to have a significant impact on lending activity, which will ultimately slow the economy. When combined with interest rate hikes and reductions in quantitative easing, we anticipate that economic activity will be significantly affected in the coming months.',\n",
       "  'The rise in interest rates has resulted in several repercussions, including increased borrowing costs for companies and governments. This is particularly evident for companies that heavily rely on financing to sustain their operations, such as a majority of U.S. companies and the U.S. government itself. The U.S. government, for instance, currently bears a massive debt of $31 trillion, equivalent to 120% of the country’s GDP. With approximately $7 trillion of this debt maturing and needing to be reissued each year at higher interest rates, the burden of interest payments has surged. In 2021, the interest payments amounted to $352 billion; by 2022, these had spiked to $475 billion. Projections indicate that these will further escalate to $640 billion in 2023 due to the elevated reinvestment rates. In essence, the heightened interest rates are significantly driving up the U.S. national debt.',\n",
       "  'The Fed is keenly focused on reducing inflation to meet its 2% target, which requires implementing tighter monetary policies to create more slack in the labor market. The nonfarm payroll report for March 2023 suggests that the labor market is cooling to some extent, although further efforts are needed. The change in nonfarm payrolls for March was 236,000, in line with consensus estimates, but lower than the 12-month average of 342,000. Fed officials were likely encouraged by the drop in average hourly earnings on an annual basis to 4.2%, from 4.6% at the end of 2022. On the other hand, the overall unemployment rate fell to 3.4% for January 2023, its lowest level since 1969, before ticking up to 3.5% for March.',\n",
       "  'However, despite the historic rate increases in 2022 and 2023, the Fed considers the labor market to still be too tight, necessitating continued interest rate hikes, albeit at a slower pace and with more modest increases compared to 2022. Quantitative tightening is also expected to proceed in 2023. Currently, there is a widespread prediction, with an 86% probability, that the Fed will raise rates again in May. While some economists anticipate that the Fed may eventually stop raising rates and even cut rates by the end of the year due to a potential significant weakening of the economy, the demand side of the labor market presents concerns.',\n",
       "  'The Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) for February showed that the number of job openings nationwide was 9.9 million, the first time it has dipped below 10 million since May 2021. This indicates that, while there are more job opportunities than job seekers, the labor market remains tight. The Fed aims to avoid wage-price spiral inflation, wherein higher wages result in increased costs for companies, which may pass on the burden to consumers. Therefore, it is crucial for the Fed to cautiously slow the job market to tame inflation without causing a significant spike in the unemployment rate.',\n",
       "  'The first quarter of 2023 was marked by volatility in the financial markets as investors closely monitored the Federal Reserve’s stance on inflation and interest rates. However, investors’ reactions to economic data were often puzzling, with good news sometimes leading to negative market reactions and vice versa. Despite this uncertainty, equity markets rallied, with major indexes like the S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq composite posting positive gains. Mega-cap growth stocks, particularly in the technology sector, performed well, benefiting from lower interest rates and their safe-haven characteristics.',\n",
       "  'On the other hand, the bond market also experienced volatility, but with a different trend compared to 2022. Bond prices rose as yields fell, despite the Fed’s two rate hikes during the quarter. The Bloomberg Aggregate, a bond market index, returned 3.0%, the best performance since the first quarter of 2020 when the COVID-19 pandemic triggered a flight to safety. However, yields for Treasuries reached their lowest levels of the year in March, with the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield ranging from 3.30% to 4.05% during the quarter. The bond market’s volatility exceeded that of the stock market, with the 10-year Treasury yield dropping 41 basis points to 3.47% in the first quarter of 2023.',\n",
       "  'Looking ahead, Mutual of America expects volatility to remain elevated in 2023 as markets continue to react to short-term data and policymakers’ comments. Key issues to watch include the Federal Reserve’s efforts to tame inflation and avoid a recession, the job market, corporate earnings and the health of the financial sector. Despite the uncertain market conditions, equity markets have rallied, particularly in the technology sector, while the bond market has seen increased volatility but with bond prices rising as yields fell.

       "  'It’s been two years since the U.S. economy began to experience a dramatic rise in inflation. Consumers continue to feel its impact, and the outlook for the financial markets and economy remains uncertain. Since the middle of last year, the U.S. Federal Reserve has taken aggressive actions to ease inflation through a steady increase in interest rates. While inflation has declined from its peak levels of last summer, it remains well above the Fed’s target of around 2%. Along with increased borrowing costs across the economy, we have also been affected by bank failures, debt ceiling drama and the ongoing war in Ukraine. So, where does this leave consumers and the markets?',\n",
       "  'In early March, it appeared the Fed was on target to continue its focus on aggressive interest rate hikes and keeping rates higher for a longer period in 2023 to bring down prices by reducing consumer demand. Then, instability hit the banking sector, with the failure of Silicon Valley Bank, a mid-sized bank in California, followed by Signature Bank and First Republic Bank. Across the pond in Europe, UBS took over Swiss rival Credit Suisse Group. With the banking system generally healthier than it was heading into the 2008 financial crisis, and the risk of financial contagion largely in the rearview mirror, focus has turned to a contraction in bank lending, which may put further pressure on the economy.',\n",
       "  'Through the end of May, the S&P 500® Index was up more than 9%, and the bond market was up over 2%. While these advances have been welcome, after the declines in both equity and bond markets last year, we would caution that the equity market has been driven almost entirely by large technology stocks, particularly those tied in some way to artificial intelligence (AI). Broader measures of stock market performance continue to lag, and many investors are still expecting the U.S. economy to slip into recession later this year.',\n",
       "  'Inflation has eased in recent months, declining from a high of 9% last summer to slightly below 5% for the 12-month period ending in April. While this represents progress, the Fed remains well above its committed target rate of 2% inflation, despite 10 interest rate hikes in the past year.',\n",
       "  'Although lower inflation has provided some relief to consumers, they are still feeling the pinch. The Consumer Price Index declined to 4.9% for April as high prices for some essential services and goods, such as food, finally began to ease. However, these were somewhat offset by increases in prices for gas, used cars and housing, with the latter being one of the largest contributing factors of inflationary pressure. It is expected that the Fed may skip another rate hike at its meeting in mid-June, but remains ready to continue raising rates as needed. Given recent inflation readings, and with the labor market remaining tight, odds are that the Fed could very well be back at it again soon.',\n",

       "  'Adding to these concerns, the current price/earnings ratio for the S&P 500, as reported by FactSet, stands at approximately 18.9 times, surpassing the year’s initial value of 16.7 times and surpassing the 25-year historical average of 16.8 times. This suggests that stocks are currently not priced at a bargain. While multiples have expanded since the beginning of the year, the market breadth, which indicates the number of stocks participating in the market rally, has been narrow. A mere eight stocks, namely Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Netflix, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla, now account for a significant 30% of the weight in the S&P 500. To put it in perspective, these same stocks represented only 22% of the market capitalization at the start of this year.',\n",
       "  'Despite various challenges, such as the Federal Reserve’s rate hike, inflationary pressures, the potential for a recession and uncertainties surrounding the debt ceiling, equity markets have generally shown upward movement. Major indexes like the S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq have posted positive returns, with the Nasdaq outperforming the Dow by the widest margin since 2001. Mega-cap growth stocks, particularly in the technology sector, have led the way in driving the overall performance of the equity markets. However, the bond market recently presented a different picture, with rising bond yields and falling prices, indicating a divergence from the synchronized movement with equities seen in the first quarter of this year.',\n",
       "  'Looking ahead, Mutual of America expects market volatility to remain elevated throughout 2023. Factors like inflation management, job market conditions, corporate earnings, resolution of the debt ceiling and the overall health of the financial sector will be closely monitored. While equity markets have shown strength, concerns over equity valuations, declining corporate earnings and a potential slowdown in growth are emerging. The housing market has been impacted by higher mortgage rates, and the manufacturing sector has contracted. Commodity prices have started to recede, indicating a potential economic slowdown, and changes in the banking sector may lead to tightened lending standards. These and other factors suggest that certain sectors of the economy are beginning to slow down. With all of this in mind, and amidst such uncertainty continuing in the months ahead, investors need to carefully assess their investment strategies.',\n",

       "  'The past few months have seen increasing turbulence in the financial markets as the United States economy attempts to navigate persistently high inflation, geopolitical instability from the war in Ukraine and a long-term recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. For both investors and savers, while the uncertainty and market fluctuations can be jarring, it is important not to let these—and other temporary events—influence your long-term financial planning.',\n",
       "  'Since the U.S. Federal Reserve shared plans earlier this year to implement a series of benchmark interest rate hikes during 2022, it has, in fact, done so at each of the last three Federal Open Committee Meetings. The most recent, announced on June 15, was an increase of 75 basis points—the largest rate hike since 1994. The rate and frequency of additional hikes remain to be seen, but the Fed has indicated that it is focused on bringing down the highest inflation the United States has seen in four decades, which signals that there likely is more to come. While additional interest rate hikes are now also being evaluated against the rising concern of a recession, these increases are currently viewed by the Fed as necessary to combat inflation and restore price stability—something Americans are desperately seeking—as prices continue to rise to record levels for everything from food to gas.',\n",
       "  'The European Central Bank also recently announced plans to raise its benchmark interest rates for the first time in 11 years. As inflation and geopolitical uncertainty affect international economies, it’s likely that more central banks will continue to raise interest rates to seek price stability worldwide, just as the Fed is doing here.',\n",
       "  'As the Fed continues to raise interest rates, the cost of borrowing money for consumers is becoming greater. Higher rates increase the amount of interest consumers pay on credit cards, car loans and home mortgages. As certain consumer goods and services become more costly, the rationale is that demand for them will decrease and eventually cause overall price increases to return to more typical levels and, hopefully, do so without tipping the country into an economic recession.',\n",
       "  'According to the CoreLogic Home Price Index, home prices rose 20.9% year-over-year and 3.3% from February to March, which is the fastest pace on record. This surge has potentially overvalued homes, pricing many buyers out of the market. Given the significant increase in mortgage rates that we have seen over the last few months, it is expected that the housing market may cool over the balance of the year.',\n",
       "  'Despite the recent market turbulence, the labor market has remained strong, with the Fed projecting unemployment to remain below 4% for the rest of the year. Low unemployment and a strong job market, combined with higher levels of savings remaining from many of the pandemic relief fiscal programs, should help support a rebound in consumer spending, which makes up the largest portion of the domestic economy.',\n",
       "  'As inflation rises and continues to negatively impact the spending power of consumers, market commentators have debated whether the Fed is taking the appropriate steps to combat rising prices. While it is widely acknowledged that the Fed started raising interest rates too late, it has also recently begun what’s called quantitative tightening—which is the process of shrinking the Fed’s own balance sheet by not reinvesting proceeds from maturing Treasury securities and mortgage-backed securities. Quantitative tightening and raising interest rates at the same time is a critical move for the Fed to enforce its mandate of price stability.',\n",
       "  'Despite the overwhelming and unceasing headlines around financial market volatility, inflation and higher interest rates, it’s important to remember that when it comes to saving for retirement, the best thing you can do to ensure a strong financial future is to stick to a long-term financial plan that aligns with your risk tolerance and time horizon, maintain a diversified portfolio, and don’t let market gyrations lead you astray.',\n",

       "  'The U.S. Federal Reserve continues to work hard to reduce inflation, which has reached 40-year highs. The labor market has remained strong, and with the unemployment rate at 3.7%, giving the Fed plenty of cover to continue raising interest rates aggressively. Heading into final months of 2022, the Fed faces an uphill battle in trying to tame inflation and cool the economy while seeking to avoid a recession.',\n",
       "  'While Americans are well aware of the connection of inflation to the cost of goods and services such as food and gas, perhaps less well known is the impact of wages and employment on inflation, which can often be much more difficult to predict and control.',\n",
       "  'Rising wages over the past year have been a positive for workers as it’s helped offset price pressures, but it has also kept pressure on the Fed to remain aggressive as inflation remains slower to change at very high levels. As average wages have risen, consumer demand for goods and services remains strong, even as interest rates on credit cards and loans have increased. While the labor market remains a bright spot, cracks are starting to show in the economy. The Fed hikes are beginning to take a toll—most notably through the softening housing market and declining auto sales—as consumers reconsider taking on more debt to make larger purchases.',\n",
       "  'One area that the Fed will continue to pay close attention to is the labor force participation rate, which is the percentage of people 16 years and older who are working or actively looking for work. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the October workforce participation rate of 62.2% was still well below the pre-pandemic rate of 63.4% in February 2020. When fewer people actively seek employment, pressure increases on employers to raise wages to attract and retain qualified workers. A lack of workers to produce goods and services in demand by consumers then pushes prices up, which feeds back into rising wages. A growing labor force would have a positive effect on wage inflation and would be a preferred scenario for the Fed to see labor pressures ease, as opposed to the combination of a softening economy and worker layoffs.',\n",
       "  'Even as the Fed gets a better handle on wage inflation, external factors such as the war between Russia and Ukraine are likely to continue to disrupt global energy and food prices for the near future. While gasoline prices steadily dropped through the summer, in recent weeks they have begun to creep back up and remain above average from this time last year. Also, as winter approaches, natural gas and other fuels become more essential to heat homes, which could be another significant hit to consumer wallets.',\n",
       "  'After the Consumer Price Index came in at 8.2% for September, down just 0.1% from August, it became clear that the Fed would need to continue its aggressive rate hikes. On November 2, the Fed raised rates by another 75 basis points, and Fed Chairman Jerome Powell continued to sound very hawkish in his remarks. It’s worth noting that if the Fed rate hikes and those other factors help bring inflation down from where it is currently, that’s a positive trend. However, anything above the Fed’s target rate for inflation of 2% could prevent the Fed from easing its rate hike campaign. That 2% target is generally thought of as indicating “stable prices,” and would provide balance to businesses and workers by allowing businesses to increase prices at around 2% annually and workers to receive cost-of-living wage increases of at least 2% to afford goods and services.',\n",
       "  'The bottom line is that the Fed is in a tough spot as it aggressively attempts to reduce inflation while trying to avoid tipping the economy into a recession. Financial markets have been volatile this year, as investors adjust to a world with higher interest rates and the potential for a recession in 2023. With this in mind, investors should continue to monitor their portfolios to ensure that their investments align with their risk tolerance and investment timelines, especially if they are nearing their desired retirement age. As always, they should stay focused on long-term investment goals, rather than trying to time markets.',\n",

The S&P 500® Index returned 8.7% during the second quarter to finish a surprisingly strong first half of 2023 up 16.9%. This occurred despite facing an additional three interest rate hikes of 0.25% each, with the prospect of more to come in July and September. Additional headwinds, such as persistent inflationary pressures, a robust job market and a looming threat of a recession, complicate the landscape for the financial markets and economy.',\n",

       "  'In the first six months of the year, the major equity indexes were all highlighted by positive performances. The S&P 500 Index rose 16.9%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average showed a modest increase of 4.9%, and the Nasdaq composite displayed significant growth, jumping 32.3%. The latter’s return in the first half was its strongest since 1983. It is worth noting that, during this period, the Nasdaq outperformed the Dow by the widest margin since 2001, particularly due to its focus on technology-related companies. The Russell 1000® Growth Index outperformed the Russell 1000® Value Index by over 24%.',\n",
       "  'Thus far this year, the U.S. equity markets have been dominated by mega-cap growth stocks. The average year-to-date return, through June 30, on Amazon, Apple, Google, Meta, Microsoft, Netflix, Nvidia and Tesla, was a stunning 59%. It’s worth noting, however, that the average year-to-date return for the rest of the S&P 500 was just 3.7%. Apple’s market cap—which represents its total outstanding shares of stock multiplied by its price—is now the same as the entire Russell 2000® Small Cap Index. These eight companies represent the highest share of market cap on record, at 28%. Further, the percentage of stocks beating the S&P 500 on a trailing three-month basis was just 11%, surpassing the March 2000 low of 20%. Not surprisingly, the equal-weighted S&P 500 was only up 7.0% year to date. It is also interesting to note that the Dow return of 4.9% was driven entirely by Microsoft and Apple, which together make up 10% of the weight in that index.',\n",
       "  'Despite strong returns in both the first and second quarters, those returns have not completely made up for the losses from 2022. Over the last 18 months, the S&P 500 is down 4.3%, the Dow is down 2.3%, and the Nasdaq Composite is down 10.7%. However, in looking at returns since March 17, 2022, the day of the Fed’s first interest rate hike, the picture looks much different and much more even: the S&P 500 Index is up 3.0%, the Dow is up 2.5%, and the Nasdaq Composite is up 2.5%.',\n",
       "  'Despite a slight decline in bond prices in the second quarter, the bond market showed strength on a year-to-date basis through June, largely driven by decreasing interest rates starting in the latter part of 2022. The 10-year Treasury yield reached its peak at 4.23% last October. By the end of March, it had fallen to 3.47%, before moving back up by the end of June to 3.83%. Year to date, the 10-year Treasury generated a positive return of 1.7%, the 30-year Treasury yielded a return of 3.3%, the Bloomberg U.S. Corporate Bond Index rose 3.2%, and the Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Index delivered a 2.1% return.',\n",
       "  'The persistently inverted yield curve continues to serve as a potential indicator of an impending economic slowdown. In 2022, the yield curve initially inverted on April 1, with the 2-year Treasury yielding more than the 10-year Treasury. Although the curve briefly returned to its normal shape, another inversion between the 2-year and 10-year Treasuries occurred in early July. Then, in late October, the yield on the short-term 3-month Treasury bill surpassed that of the 10-year Treasury. As 2022 drew to a close, the inversion intensified, and then, in the initial months of 2023, the spread widened further. Presently, the interest rates offered by 3-month Treasury bills are more than 1.45% higher than those provided by 10-year Treasury bonds.',\n",
       "  'The significance of an inverted yield curve lies in its reflection of how investors perceive the trajectory of the U.S. economy. If there is a prevailing belief in an upcoming slump or recession, investors tend to flock toward long-term U.S. bonds, causing the inversion. Notably, an inverted yield curve has preceded the 10 most recent recessions, underscoring its historical correlation with economic downturns.',\n",

       "  'Millions of borrowers have been stuck in a state of uncertainty, eagerly awaiting the fulfillment of President Biden’s campaign promise for student debt cancellation. Finally, in August of last year, his administration unveiled plans for student loan forgiveness. These plans aimed to cancel up to $20,000 for eligible borrowers, totaling approximately $400 billion. However, the administration’s efforts were thwarted in June when the U.S. Supreme Court blocked the implementation of the student loan forgiveness program.',\n",

On pause since March 13, 2020, federal student loan payments are scheduled to resume on October 1, 2023, with interest starting to accrue once again in September. According to data from Experian, student loan borrowers will start to make an average payment of $203 later this summer toward their student loan balances, assuming no further reductions in the average due to student loan forgiveness. Although this amount may be lower than typical car payments, it adds another financial obligation for many individuals already grappling with increased living expenses due to inflation.',\n",
       "  'Taking a closer look at data on nonstudent debt shows that borrowers are already struggling. The median cost of servicing this other debt has increased by 24% since the pandemic began, as a result of higher interest rates and larger balances on auto loans and credit cards. Delinquency rates by historical standards are still low, but they are on the rise. As of March, nearly 8% of borrowers were at least 60 days late on payments, up from 5% in July 2021. To compound the issue, these delinquencies primarily affect middle-aged borrowers who carry substantial loan balances and should ideally be focused on savings during their prime years.',\n",

However, June’s number is still above the long-term historical average—from 1939 to 2023, nonfarm payrolls averaged 125,000 per month, according to Trading Economics.',\n",
       "  'More worrisome, average hourly earnings remained steady at 4.4%, consistent with recent trends. Wage inflation, caused by high labor demand, the retirement of baby boomers and historically low labor-participation rates, has given workers leverage when negotiating contracts. A few recent examples of workers who negotiated significant wage increases include dockworkers on the West Coast, FedEx pilots and Delta Air Lines pilots. Additionally, hotel workers in Southern California are striking for higher wages, and UPS is engaged in contract negotiations with the Teamsters Union over pay for drivers.',\n",
       "  'The Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) for May revealed that there were 9.8 million job openings nationwide, down from 10.1 million in April. This indicates that there are more job opportunities available than there are job seekers, underscoring the tightness of the labor market. The Fed’s objective is to prevent wage-price spiral inflation, where higher wages lead to increased costs for companies that may subsequently pass on the burden to consumers. Hence, it is crucial for the Fed to cautiously manage the pace of job market growth in order to curb inflation without causing a significant surge in the unemployment rate.',\n",
       "  'In an attempt to address rising inflation in early 2022, the Fed embarked on a proactive path of raising interest rates beginning in March 2022. To date, a cumulative increase of five percentage points has been implemented, and the repercussions of 10 rate hikes are beginning to manifest in the economy. Nevertheless, it is essential to recognize that interest rate policy is a broad tool with prolonged and uneven effects. There are indications that the rate hikes are starting to impact specific sectors of the economy.',\n",
       "  'The housing market is one area where the influence is particularly noticeable, as higher mortgage rates are causing a slowdown. In 2022, the 30-year fixed mortgage rate commenced at 3.1% and reached a peak of 7.1% in November. Through June of 2023, the rate stood at 6.8%. Not surprisingly, June mortgage applications were down 4.4%. Housing affordability is at multidecade lows, hurt by home-price appreciation, higher mortgage rates and limited inventory.',\n",

While the initial reading in 2022 was 58.8, by June 2023, it had experienced a substantial decline, contracting by 12.8 points to 46.0. This decline, which signifies a reduction in ordering activity at the nation’s factories, marked the eighth month of contraction and the longest contraction trend since the Great Recession of 2008–09.',\n",
       "  'Commodity prices have also started to recede, indicating a potential economic slowdown. This marks a reversal from a year ago. As of June 30, 2023, the S&P GSCI commodity index was down 11.4% year to date, and prices of energy, grains and other raw materials have all declined.',\n",

As we start the second-quarter reporting season, analysts are expecting earnings in the S&P 500 to decline by 7.5%—this would represent the third consecutive quarterly earnings drop. One contributing factor to this earnings decline is the reduction in profit margins. Despite healthy revenue growth, rising costs have exerted pressure on margins, leading to a squeeze in profits. In fact, profit margins have decreased for the last seven quarters.',\n",
       "  'Adding to these concerns, the current price/earnings ratio for the S&P 500, as reported by FactSet, stands at approximately 18.9 times, surpassing the year’s initial value of 16.7 times and surpassing the 25-year historical average of 16.8 times. This suggests that stocks are currently not priced at a bargain. While multiples have expanded since the beginning of 2023, the market breadth, which indicates the number of stocks participating in the market rally, has been narrow. A mere eight stocks—namely Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Netflix, Nvidia and Tesla—now account for a significant 28% of the weight in the S&P 500. To put it in perspective, these same stocks represented only 22% of the market capitalization at the start of this year.',\n",
       "  'Despite various challenges, such as the Federal Reserve’s rate hikes, inflationary pressures and the looming recession, equity markets have generally shown upward movement. Major equity indexes like the S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq have posted positive returns, with the Nasdaq having its best first-half performance since 1983. Mega-cap growth stocks, particularly in the technology sector, have led the way in driving the overall performance of the equity markets. However, the bond market recently presented a slightly different picture, with rising bond yields and falling prices, indicating a divergence from the synchronized movement with equities seen in the first quarter of this year.',\n",
       "  'Looking ahead, Mutual of America expects market volatility to remain elevated throughout 2023. Factors like inflation management, job market conditions, corporate earnings and the overall health of the financial sector will be closely monitored. While equity markets have shown strength, concerns over equity valuations, declining corporate earnings and a potential slowdown in growth are emerging. The housing market has been impacted by higher mortgage rates, and the manufacturing sector has contracted. Commodity prices have started to recede, indicating a potential economic slowdown, and changes in the banking sector may lead to tightened lending standards. These and other factors suggest that certain sectors of the economy are beginning to slow down. With all of this in mind, and amidst such uncertainty continuing in the months ahead, investors need to carefully assess their investment strategies.',\n",

       "  \"Stock market volatility is created by uncertainty. This is a normal occurrence in the life-cycle of investing, even though when it is happening, it can be very unsettling to the investor. While the causes of market volatility are almost always different, they share similarities in that there are typically sharp downward moves that can occur quickly and are generally unexpected. At the moment, we have two sources of uncertainty—the path and change frequency of the Federal Reserve's interest rate policy, and the geopolitical crisis caused by the invasion of Ukraine by Russia.\",\n",
       "  'In 2022, the Federal Reserve (\"Fed\") signaled an intent to raise interest rates and reduce its balance sheet to slow economic growth and rising inflation, a reversal from 2020, when the Fed lowered interest rates to support the economy during the Covid-19 pandemic. Rising interest rates are not necessarily \"bad,\" because they typically indicate a strong economy, but investors must assess how higher interest rates and a less accommodative Fed will affect the economy and, ultimately, company earnings and valuations.',\n",
       "  \"At the same time, there is a geopolitical crisis in Ukraine. While we are less than a week into the conflict, we have already seen energy prices rise, which hurts consumers, increases costs for many businesses and puts upward pressure on inflation. Higher prices are being felt particularly in Europe, as it is estimated that 40% of Europe's gas supply comes from Russia. Depending on the duration of the conflict, we could see a drag on the world Gross Domestic Product as higher energy prices work their way through the global economy. This complicates the picture for the Fed, which was already tasked with removing an unprecedented amount of monetary policy accommodation without tipping the economy into recession.\",\n",
       "  'It is impossible to predict market events that may occur in any given year, and studies show that market timing does not work, especially since, historically, large gains tend to follow large losses. How should an investor, especially a participant in a retirement plan, think about their portfolio? And what actions, if any, should they take?',\n",
       "  'Maintain A Long-Term Investment StrategyFirst, have a long-term investment strategy that aligns with your risk tolerance and time horizon. Asset allocation is the key driver of your potential long-term investment return and the potential volatility of your investment portfolio. Your investment time horizon can also play an important factor in reducing the impact of volatility on your portfolio. Time is a powerful ally of retirement investors, because the potential impact of volatility on a portfolio narrows as you extend the investment holding period.',\n",
       "  \"Keep A Diversified PortfolioSecond, manage volatility with a diversified portfolio. Target-date funds and asset allocation funds generally provide participants with an all-in-one fund approach that is diversified among asset classes and investment styles.* If you construct your own portfolio, consider balancing investments between different asset classes and investment styles, and don't concentrate the portfolio in one particular fund or style. Note, however, that diversification does not guarantee investment returns or eliminate the risk of loss.\",\n",
       "  'Continue to Save for RetirementThird, continue to contribute to your retirement plan through regular deductions. By maintaining consistent contributions to your retirement portfolio, you are dollar-cost averaging, which ensures that you buy more when share prices dip and less when prices are high.',\n",
       "  \"Don't Make Rash DecisionsLastly, avoid the temptation to focus on short-term market trends and to make rash decisions. Market timing can be costly. Staying invested and riding out the market decline typically leads to better outcomes. 2020 was a great example. Many investors who exercised patience by not selling at the market low in March were able to participate in the significant upside throughout the rest of the year and throughout 2021.\",\n",
       "  'We believe that the current uncertainty in the stock market will run its course, and making significant changes to your investment strategy based on short-term trends can be counterproductive to achieving your long-term retirement goals.',\n",
       "  '*The value of a target date fund is not guaranteed at any time, including at and after the target date. There is no guarantee that a target date fund will correctly predict market or economic conditions, and as with other mutual fund investments, you could lose money. In addition to a target retirement date, individuals should consider their risk tolerance, time horizon, personal circumstances and complete financial situation before investing.↵',\n",

       "  'As news of rising domestic inflation and global issues, such as the war in Ukraine, continue to dominate headlines, we want to let you know that we recognize concerns you may have during these uncertain times, especially as they relate to your financial security. There are ongoing challenges on many fronts, heightened still by the Coronavirus. Much remains unresolved and the long-term impact of these current events on economic growth is unknown—but keeping a long-term perspective when thinking about your finances is important. Remember that, despite the current environment, the money in your retirement savings is intended to help you achieve financial security for your future.',\n",
       "  'Equity market downturns are not uncommon. While market declines can seem significant from a short-term perspective, markets have historically recovered over the longer term. For example, over the past 40 years, equity markets, as shown by the S&P 500®, have gone up 85% of the time.',\n",
       "  'Compounding of returns over time is a powerful force for achieving retirement goals. That\\'s why it\\'s important to focus on your time in the market over the long term, rather than attempting to time when to get in and out of the market. While it may seem tempting to try to get out of the market to avoid losses, the truth is that nobody knows when it will be the \"right\" time to get back in, and missing the eventual rebound can impact longer-term performance.',\n",
       "  '\"Investing for retirement should be looked at like running a marathon,\" said Stephen Rich, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Mutual of America Capital Management LLC.1 \"In this context, investment performance in any one month, or months, is just a very small part of the journey. In fact, for long-term investors, maintaining your discipline can be very advantageous during this time, in that you are buying stocks at current lower prices, which could increase the potential return over the long term.\"',\n",
       "  'Asset allocation and diversification are the two most important factors in long-term investing success. The combination of equities and bonds, including among the funds you choose, can determine your potential future returns, as well as the volatility, or up-and-down movement, in your portfolio. Having a diversified portfolio that is appropriate for your time horizon and risk tolerance, and that you can stick with during short periods of market volatility, is a sensible approach for retirement savings and investing.2',\n",
       "  'Our Asset Allocation Funds prudently balance risk and return based on your risk tolerance, while our Target-Date Retirement Funds do the same based on your expected retirement date. For example, our 2060 Retirement Fund, which has a higher allocation to equities and is therefore more exposed to recent market movements, is appropriate given the time you have until retirement. By contrast, our 2025 Retirement Fund has a much lower allocation to equities and more to fixed income, given that the expected retirement date is within five years. While this fund will fare better in a declining equity market than the 2060 Fund, it has a lower historical and expected return over time than the 2060 Fund, given its more conservative asset allocation. Target-Date funds follow a glide path that governs their asset allocation, which helps reduce risk as you get closer to your retirement age.3',\n",

       "  'In mid-March, the Federal Reserve announced its decision to raise interest rates for the first time since 2018, despite rising financial-market volatility and the geopolitical crisis in Ukraine. The decision is expected to signal the start of multiple rate hikes designed to counter very high inflation in the U.S. economy. The hikes could be unsettling to many consumers and businesses and are likely to have a cooling effect on the economy, with mortgage rates already significantly rising.',\n",
       "  'For younger Americans, this may be their first encounter with rising interest rates, particularly as it makes borrowing for large purchases, such as houses or cars, more expensive. Higher mortgage rates could make homebuying more difficult than it already has been during the current housing boom. Many first-time buyers have struggled to get into the housing market since the start of the pandemic due to record-high home prices, low inventory and increased competition from investment firms offering cash. Similarly, purchasing a new or used car has proven more difficult and expensive than many Americans have ever experienced, given strong demand and supply-chain issues that originated during the COVID-19 lockdowns. Rising interest rates may exacerbate those trends.',\n",
       "  'There will continue to be conversations about whether the Fed started tightening monetary policy at the right time and if it is moving at the right speed. The Fed has many challenges ahead as it tries to combat the highest inflation seen in decades. In addition to raising interest rates, the Fed is shrinking its balance sheet, which has grown to unprecedented levels driven by government spending from the pandemic response programs. Regardless of the timing and speed of the Fed’s actions, the decision to raise interest rates should be seen as necessary to help lower inflation and ensure the long-term health of the economy.',\n",
       "  'The global events that have driven volatility this year are just the latest illustration of why it is impossible to accurately predict events that may impact markets over the short term. Whether it is supply-chain issues, inflation or rising interest rates, there are always external factors that impact the broad economic picture.',\n",
       "  'For individuals participating in retirement saving plans, it’s crucial to stay focused and have a long-term investment strategy that aligns with your risk tolerance and time horizon. Making investment decisions based on short-term market events or trends can be incredibly costly and undermine long-term goals. It’s also important to maintain a diversified portfolio that balances different asset classes and investment styles to help manage against market volatility. Note, however, that diversification does not guarantee investment returns or eliminate the risk of loss.',\n",
       "  'This is not the first time the Fed has raised interest rates or had to respond to uncertainty in the economy and financial markets. We believe that, as before, uncertainty will run its course. As such, adhering to a long-term investment strategy and continuing to make regular contributions to your portfolio is the best way to manage through volatility and ensure that you stay on the right path towards a successful retirement.',\n",

       "  'During the first quarter of 2022, the combination of inflation at multidecade highs, the U.S. Federal Reserve beginning to tighten monetary policy by raising interest rates, the war between Russia and Ukraine, and the lingering impact of the global pandemic resulted in a historically turbulent period both for stock and bond investors.',\n",
       "  'On the equity side, the S&P 500® Index declined 4.6%, the Nasdaq slumped 8.9% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 4.1%. On the fixed-income side, returns were just as disappointing, as the Bloomberg U.S. Corporate Bond Index declined 7.7% and the Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Bond Index fell 5.9%. One bright spot in the financial markets for investors was in the commodities sector, which soared in response to anticipated supply disruptions and global inflation pressures. For example, the prices of oil, copper and wheat all rose, and the Bloomberg Commodity Index returned 28%, its best quarterly gain since 1990.',\n",
       "  'As we move through the first half of the year, Mutual of America Capital Management LLC continues to see volatility both in equities and bonds as uncertainty surrounds the consequences and outcome of the war in Ukraine and the ability of the Fed to tame inflation by raising interest rates without tipping the economy into recession.',\n",
       "  'Watch the April Economic & Market Perspective webinar with Stephen Rich.',\n",
       "  'Given the elevated levels of uncertainty, stocks got off to a rough start in the first quarter, declining 4.6%, marking its worst quarter in two years. In fact, during the quarter, the S&P 500 closed down 35 times, the most drawdowns in a first quarter that it has suffered since 1984. Further, the S&P 500 suffered a peak-to-trough slide of 13% at its worst, while the Nasdaq 100® and the Russell 2000® Index each entered bear market territory with declines exceeding 20%. Surprisingly, in the second half of March, the equity markets recovered in record time from the shock of the war in Ukraine and its potential consequences on global supply chains. In fact, from the day Russia invaded Ukraine, on February\\xa024, 2022, through the end of the quarter on March\\xa031, the S&P 500 returned 7.4%.',\n",
       "  'In the first quarter, the Russell 1000® Value Index (down 0.7%) outperformed the Russell 1000 Growth Index (down 9.0) by 8.3%. Given that higher interest rates make future earnings less valuable, it was not surprising to see the value sector outperform the growth sector among large cap and small cap equities.',\n",
       "  'Interest rates have been on a downward trend since the early 1980s, meaning that bond prices have been in a prolonged bull market. This decades-long rally was supercharged by the massive central bank response in 2020, due to the pandemic’s economic toll when rates fell to record lows. Since the pandemic started receding, however, bonds have come under increasing pressure as inflation began working its way into the financial system. As such, inflation pressures are much broader and more serious than they were at this time last year. In December of 2021, the Fed changed its narrative and openly stated that inflation was not going to be as transitory as it had originally thought. On March 16, the Fed approved a 0.25 percentage point rate hike, the first increase since December 2018.',\n",
       "  'During the first quarter of this year, the 10-year Treasury rose 82.8 basis points, to 2.34%, after finishing 2021 at 1.51%. Additionally, the two-year Treasury surpassed the 10-year Treasury, marking a so-called inversion of the yield curve, something not seen since 2019. Inverted yield curves have preceded most recessions in the past, and the latest yield moves have stirred debate among investors and economists over whether the economy may be headed into a recession. With interest rates rising aggressively, bond prices fell during the quarter. The 10-year Treasury was down 6.7%, the 30-year Treasury declined 11.4%, the Bloomberg U.S. Corporate Bond Index fell 7.7% and the Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Index declined 5.9%. Although this data reflects just the first three months of 2022, it’s worth noting that bonds finished 2021 with a negative return and that it’s extremely unusual for bonds to have negative returns in back-to-back years. In fact, the last time that happened was in 1956.',\n",
       "  'Taking a closer look at inflation, it continues to be problematic in the U.S., and its persistent rise is being caused by a variety of factors, including increases in global commodities, rising consumer demand, wage pressures and supply-chain bottlenecks. All three well-known inflation gauges showed heightened and increasing levels well above the Fed’s average target of 2.0%: 1) the Bureau of Economic Affairs’ Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE), the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge, was up 6.4% year over year; 2) the Producer Price Index, which sometimes predicts the direction of consumer prices, was up 11.2%; and 3) the Consumer Price Index (CPI), the most widely recognized gauge, was up 8.5%—its highest level since June of 1982. The CPI provides a statistical measure of the average change in prices in a fixed market basket of consumer goods and services. The March CPI came in at 8.5%, marking the 13th consecutive month that inflation was above the Fed’s target rate.',\n",
       "  'The ongoing effect of inflation has directly impacted consumers’ purchasing power. Gas prices continued to climb nationwide during 2022, with a national average of $4.33 per gallon on March 28, 2022. Just a year ago, the national average was $2.94. In many states, the current price is at all-time highs. Under pressure to provide some relief to U.S. consumers, the Biden administration announced on March 31 that the U.S. would release one million barrels of oil per day from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in an effort to help cut gas prices and fight inflation. Food prices also continue to rise. The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) Economic Research Service updated its March report, predicting a 4.5%–5% rise overall in food prices this year. The report stated that the cost of eating out is expected to show the highest increases, at 5.5%–6.5%. The most recent Standard & Poor’s CoreLogic Case–Shiller Home Price Indices, from December 2021, reported a 19.1% annual gain. While down slightly from the 19.7% peak in September 2021, these are very strong numbers that will continue to keep the CPI elevated in the coming months.',\n",
       "  'At the start of 2022, commodity prices were already elevated; however, the war in Ukraine exacerbated the problem. With fears of potential supply disruption in the oil markets due to the ongoing war, crude prices surged above $100 per barrel for the first time since 2014. While sanctions originally placed on Russia by the West did not specifically target Russia’s oil and gas producers, buyers of Russian energy products struggled to secure guarantees at Western banks and find ships to deliver these products. Russia is the world’s second-largest producer of crude products and provides about 35% of Europe’s natural gas supply (including 50% of Germany’s supply). Russia is also the world’s second-largest producer (after Canada) of fertilizer, a key nutrient used on major commodity crops and produce.',\n",
       "  'With this in mind, farmers in the U.S. are bracing for a hike in the price of fertilizer, which was already at a record-high before the conflict. According to American Farm Bureau Federation and USDA data, fertilizer is expected to jump 12% this year, after rising 17% last year. If American farmers decide to use less fertilizer, that could curb yields for the fall harvest at a time when the world may need greater supplies of grain. In addition, prices of the following major commodities significantly rose in the 12-month period ending March\\xa031, 2022: aluminum (+58%); nickel (+100%); coffee (+89%); corn (+33%); wheat (+68%); sugar (+31%); and cotton (+76%). All of these are major inputs in the products Americans use every day, and consumers will continue to feel the pain of these increases as manufacturers pass the costs along in the form of higher prices.',\n",
       "  'Faced with this commodity-driven inflation spike, the Fed is now headed for its most aggressive monetary policy tightening in almost three decades. During a press conference on April\\xa05, 2022, Federal Reserve Governor Lael Brainard said the Fed “will continue tightening monetary policy methodically through a series of interest rate increases and by starting to reduce the balance sheet at a rapid pace as soon as our May meeting.” She also made it clear that, “given that the recovery has been considerably stronger and faster than in the previous cycle,” the $8.5 trillion balance sheet will be reduced at a faster pace than when the Fed attempted the last quantitative tightening (QT) in 2017 and 2018. A day later, the Fed announced that it would begin to reduce its massive bond holdings at a pace of as much as $95 billion a month to further tighten credit, at the same time that it is raising interest rates in an effort to cool the economy. The $95 billion a month is nearly double the peak rate of $50 billion the last time the Fed trimmed its balance sheet.',\n",
       "  'At the current time, the financial markets are anticipating cumulative rate hikes of 2.25% points, on top of the 0.25% increase already delivered by the Fed in March. The Fed has not done this much tightening—2.50%—in one year since 1994, a terrible year for the bond market that even included a 0.75% point hike. The financial markets are now expecting a 0.50% rate hike in May, which would be the largest rate increase since 2000. With inflation (as measured by the CPI) heading for more than 8%—a rate not seen in 40 years—Fed officials have adopted a decidedly more hawkish tone.',\n",
       "  'Strong Consumer and Tight Labor Markets Lower Recession Risk',\n",
       "  'The Fed clearly has an enormous task ahead to reduce inflation without making a policy mistake. Recently, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said the economy was “very strong and well positioned to handle tighter monetary policy.” The business cycle is still on solid ground, with the Conference Board’s Leading Economic Index® (LEI) for the U.S. up 7.6% year over year in its most recent reading. The positive news is that, in addition to a strong economy and tight labor market, U.S. consumers have accumulated excess savings to help manage against rising prices.',\n",
       "  'A tight labor market should make it harder for the economy to spiral into a recession. This has the potential to give the Fed some breathing room as it embarks on its tightening cycle with the hope of guiding the economy to a soft landing that avoids a recession. In the first quarter, the labor markets continued to report job growth as they did in 2021. In March, nonfarm payrolls increased by 431,000. There were also positive revisions to previously reported numbers for January and February, indicating that the job market is performing well. The most recent Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) survey also showed that workers are rejoining the labor force at a rapid pace. March’s participation rate rose to 62.4% (the rate was at 60.2% in April of 2020) and is almost back to its 63.4% rate measured in January and February of 2020. Moreover, by the end of March, the unemployment rate hit a new pandemic low of 3.6%, which is just above the pre-pandemic level (and 50-year low) of 3.5% in March of 2020. If activity remains on track, unemployment is likely to fall below the pre-pandemic levels to rates not seen since 1953. Looking at the BLS’s Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) for January showed that the number of job openings nationwide was 11.26 million. This is an indication that the labor market is tight, with a greater supply of jobs than demand for jobs.',\n",
       "  '2021 was the most profitable year for American companies since 1950. In 2022, profit growth is expected to slow to roughly 9% in the fiscal year 2022, down significantly from the 2021 fiscal year’s growth of 46%. Additionally, as the Fed tightens monetary policy, profit margins are likely to start to deteriorate. Most macroeconomists estimate that the S&P 500 will earn $228 a share in 2022. Currently, the S&P 500 trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 19.7, which is elevated relative to the historic range of 14 to 15 times for forward multiples. After a rough start to the year, the S&P 500 has quietly climbed back to within 4% of its record, set on January 3, 2022. The S&P 500 finished up 1% or greater on nine trading days during March. Many strategists continue to believe the U.S. stock market is still the best place to invest, given the outlook in other regions of the world. As the popular adage goes: There Is No Alternative (TINA). Still, some strategists insist the recent rebound is just a bear market rally. Either way, volatility is likely to continue as a result of decelerating earnings growth, high valuations and an interest-rate tightening cycle.',\n",
       "  'While the financial markets navigated through a significant downward swing during the first quarter of 2022 before experiencing a late rebound, there are a number of issues impacting the markets and economy worth keeping an eye on through the first half of this year. On the positive side, the country continues to see strong jobs growth, near-record-low unemployment rates, robust corporate earnings, healthy consumer spending from excess savings, and still relatively low interest rates. On the negative side, inflation continues to rise to levels not seen in decades, as supply-chain disruptions persist and war between Russia and Ukraine intensifies. Further, rising prices for food and commodities (such as gas), as well as the Federal Reserve’s start of interest rate hikes, continue to affect consumers’ purchasing power.',\n",
       "  'With all of this in mind, the Fed clearly recognizes that inflation is a major problem and is expected to use all of the tools in its arsenal to cool the economy, engineer a soft landing and avoid a recession. While the COVID-19 Omicron variant is largely diminished, increases in cases of the BA.2 variant have created some uncertainty about future economic disruptions. For now, however, economic growth has returned to pre-pandemic levels, which should allow the Fed to focus on fighting inflation. Volatility in the stock and bond markets is likely to continue as long as these issues remain. Among stocks, especially the top names in the S&P 500, valuations remain potentially stretched. With this in mind, we continue to favor value-oriented stocks, especially as interest rates rise during the year. We will continue to monitor these issues and other events that might impact our outlook in the coming months.',\n",

       "  'During 2021, all three of the major financial markets provided an extraordinarily good year for equities, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average, Nasdaq and S&P 500® Index finishing the year at or near all-time highs. Several events led to these record highs, including the rollout of Covid-19 vaccines, unprecedented U.S. government fiscal and monetary support, strong consumer balance sheets, sturdy consumer spending and robust corporate earnings. Building in the background on the domestic front, however, were some potentially unfavorable trends, especially by year-end: the highly contagious Omicron variant of Covid-19, tighter monetary policy, the highest inflation in 30 years, the failure to pass more fiscal stimulus, and modest earnings growth in the equity market. Mutual of America Capital Management LLC looks at the impact these issues had on the economy and financial markets in 2021 and explores how they may influence market movements in early 2022.',\n",
       "  'Watch the Economic & Market Perspective webinar with Stephen Rich.',\n",
       "  'Even in the face of accelerating headwinds last year, the equity markets rallied. For example, the S&P 500 increased by 4.5% in December and finished 2021 up 28.7%—easily outpacing its 18.4% rise in 2020. During the year, the S&P 500 set 70 record highs, which is the second-most ever, behind the 77 in 1995. It was also the third-highest annual gain on record; and there was only one pullback of 5% in September. In the last three-year period, the S&P 500 doubled, something the Index had not achieved in a three-year period since the 1995–2000 stretch of the Technology Bubble, also known as the Dot-Com Bubble. Over the most recent two-year period, U.S. equity markets outperformed international equity markets, reflecting the earlier vaccination adoption success in the United States. Value stocks, both large and small, achieved much better returns than in 2020. This was especially true in the first half of 2021, given their high operating leverage to the reopening of the economy.',\n",
       "  'Performance of Select Indexes – Calendar-Year Returns',\n",
       "  'The 10-year U.S. Treasury bond yield was on a roller coaster most of the year as investors debated whether inflation in the economy was transitory or more of a long-term problem. To recap, yields began the year at 0.91%, hit a one-year high of 1.74% on March\\xa031, 2021, fell to 1.17% by August\\xa03, 2021, and rose once again to 1.51% by December\\xa031, 2021. At this point, the 10-year Treasury is back to pre-pandemic levels and, given the outlook on inflation, yields appear likely to trend higher. For the full-year period, the 10-year Treasury was down 3.7%, the 30-year Treasury declined 4.7%, the Bloomberg U.S. Corporate Bond Index declined 1.0%, and the Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Index declined 1.5%.',\n",
       "  \"Inflation continues to be problematic, and its rise is being caused by a variety of factors, including increases in global commodities, rising consumer demand, wage pressures and supply-chain bottlenecks. By November of last year, all three well-known inflation gauges showed heightened and increasing levels well above the U.S. Federal Reserve's average target of 2.0%: 1) the Bureau of Economic Affairs' Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE)—the Fed's preferred inflation gauge—was up 4.7% year-over-year; 2) the Producer Price Index, which sometimes predicts the direction of consumer prices, was up 9.6%; and 3) the Consumer Price Index (CPI), the most widely recognized gauge, was up 6.8%—its highest level since June of 1982. The CPI provides a statistical measure of the average change in prices in a fixed market basket of consumer goods and services. The December CPI came in at 7.0%, marking the 10th consecutive month that inflation was above the Fed's target rate.\",\n",
       "  \"The ongoing effect of inflation has directly impacted consumers' purchasing power. Gas prices jumped nationwide during 2021, with an average of $3.38 per gallon on December\\xa027, 2021—an increase of more than $1.00 per gallon from December 2020. Food prices jumped 6.1% over the year, while used car and truck prices increased 31.4%. Home prices surged, as well. The most recent S&P/Case-Shiller U.S. National Home Price Index, from October 2021, reported a 19.1% annual gain. While down slightly from 19.7% in September 2021, these are very strong numbers that will continue to keep the CPI elevated in the coming months.\",\n",
       "  'Supply-chain issues also added to the heightened concern about inflation over the last year. These issues include global chip shortages due to supply-chain disruptions caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, a sharp rise in demand for electronic goods because more people are working from home, and a lack of investing in chip manufacturing capacity. Industries most hurt by the chip shortage include automotive and technology (especially computer, cell phone and video game manufacturers). Shipping and transportation also were affected by mounting supply-chain issues, due to a shortage of dockworkers and truckers. At the end of November, there were 94 ships waiting to dock at the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, California. The delays in shipping increased costs for consumers and continued to affect the availability of goods during the holiday season and into the new year.',\n",
       "  \"With such increases affecting consumers, it's no surprise the Fed is keenly focused on curbing inflation. The December 2021 meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), which included seven members of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, made it clear that the Fed's inflation goals have been achieved and that Chairman Jerome Powell had signaled a hawkish pivot. Part of that pivot included an accelerated pace of tapering, and the Fed now anticipates their program of quantitative easing will be concluded by March of 2022. The Fed also released a revised schedule of economic projections, which now indicates that they anticipate at least three 25-basis-point interest-rate increases during 2022. The Fed also projects that the labor market will continue to improve, with the unemployment rate declining to 3.5% by the end of 2022, which is well below its longer-run rate of 4.0%. The Fed is sending a clear message to the market that it is concerned about inflation, and it will use the tools at its disposal to keep the economy from derailing as a result of inflation.\",\n",
       "  \"As for major legislation by the federal government, President Joe Biden and Democratic leaders have already twice scaled back their ambitions for the social-spending and climate-change bill known as the Build Back Better Act—first by reducing its cost from $6 trillion to $3.5 trillion, and then down to $1.7 trillion. While West Virginia Senator Joe Manchin's opposition in December ended his party's hopes of passing the $1.75 trillion bill before the end of 2021, some Democrats hoped they could get Manchin to support an even smaller version in 2022, or pass popular components of the bill as separate, stand-alone measures. Although Manchin said he has not restarted talks with party leaders yet, it does not mean negotiations have ended. Democratic leaders see the bill's passage as critical in helping their party to gain political momentum going into the midterm elections this November. If a bill does come together, it would probably include these Democratic priorities: major climate-change provisions that include generous subsidies for green energy, enhanced child tax credits, Medicare expansion, childcare and universal preschool. These priorities would be financed with tax increases and drug price controls. The child tax credit remains the biggest sticking point, and meeting Manchin's demands would mean dropping several other major Democratic priorities.\",\n",
       "  'With consistent job growth every month in 2021, the economy added 6.45 million jobs, the highest aggregate calendar-year gain on record going back to 1940. This represents 84% of the jobs lost at the start of the pandemic, leaving the total employment level 3.6 million jobs shy of where it stood in February of 2020. The unemployment rate of 3.9% in December 2021 represented a decline of 0.3 percentage points from 4.2% in November. This marked the first time that unemployment has been under 4.0% since the pandemic began, and the largest-ever one-year drop in the unemployment rate on record. As a point of comparison, in February 2020, before the outbreak of the pandemic in the U.S., the unemployment rate was at a 50-year low of 3.5%, and the number of unemployed persons was 5.7 million.',\n",
       "  \"Even with strong job growth and a low unemployment rate, there are some indications that the labor markets may be challenged going forward. First, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics' Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) for November showed that the number of job openings nationwide was still above 10 million for the fifth month in a row. Second, the labor force participation rate in the U.S. was 61.9% in December 2021, remaining 1.5 percentage points lower than in February 2020 (63.4%) before the pandemic started—and thus representing a labor force that is nearly 2.4 million smaller. The workforce has shrunk for a number of reasons, including that: 1) many people close to retirement decided not to return to work, due to healthcare concerns and lifestyle changes; 2) childcare issues, as there is a lack of caretakers to meet demand, and the cost of care has increased; and 3) more recently, workers are hesitant to reenter the workforce due to the emergence of the Omicron variant. Another indication is that average hourly earnings continued to climb in December and were up 4.7% year over year. All told, millions of job openings, fewer people in the labor market and rising wages could exacerbate the already high levels of inflation.\",\n",
       "  \"The earnings recovery in 2021 was among the most remarkable in the modern history of the equity markets, with earnings increasing by an estimated 49%. This increase, which is the result of soaring revenue combined with a cost structure that was held flat through the pandemic, is similar to what happened after the financial crisis of 2008–09. Most macroeconomists estimate that the S&P 500 will earn $227 a share in 2022, which represents year-over-year earnings growth of 9%. Currently, the S&P 500 trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 21, which is elevated relative to the historic range of 14 to 15 times for forward multiples. Last year, the market became even more narrow, with a relatively small number of stocks driving returns. During the final week of December, while the S&P 500 was setting new record highs, 334 companies in the Index hit new 52-week lows, more than double the number that marked new one-year highs. This has happened only three other times, all in December of 1999, during the Dot-Com Bubble. Another take on this phenomenon is to look at the five largest names in the Index—Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Facebook and Alphabet—they accounted for roughly 26% of the overall 28.7% return to the Index in 2021. In related news, on January\\xa03, 2022, Apple became the first company to be worth $3 trillion. Apple's market value is greater than the $2.76 trillion Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of the United Kingdom, and it is approaching the $3.85 trillion GDP of Germany.\",\n",
       "  'As we begin a new year, there are a number of positives and negatives facing the U.S. economy and financial markets. On the positive side, the country has experienced strong jobs growth, robust corporate earnings, strong consumer spending and low interest rates. On the negative side, there are higher levels of inflation, created by a sluggish supply of labor participation and supply-chain issues. Additionally, the Omicron variant emerged, and infections surged. This variant appears to be more contagious but less lethal than previous variants, at least among the segment of the population who have been vaccinated. Therefore, it is less likely that widespread lockdowns will occur to hamper economic growth. However, this remains a risk. Finally, many stocks, especially the top names in the S&P 500, carry valuations that are potentially stretched. With this in mind, we continue to favor value-oriented stocks, which have better valuation support. We will continue to monitor these issues and other events that might impact our outlook in the coming months.',\n",

       "  'Year to date through May 2022, four key issues continue to drive a historically turbulent period for both stock and bond investors: the combination of inflation at multidecade highs, the U.S. Federal Reserve continuing to tighten monetary policy by raising interest rates, the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine, and the lingering impact of the global pandemic.',\n",
       "  'Since the start of the second quarter, the S&P 500® Index registered losses for seven consecutive weeks before rallying over 6% in the final week of May. The nearly two-month stretch was its longest losing streak since March of 2001. During the same period, bond investors did not fare much better, as yields rose and the Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Bond Index fell 3.2%.',\n",
       "  'As the end of the first half of the year nears, Mutual of America Capital Management LLC continues to see volatility in both equities and bonds as uncertainty surrounds the consequences and outcome of the war in Ukraine and the ability of the Fed to tame inflation by raising interest rates—and, at the same time, to reduce the Fed’s balance (through quantitative tightening) without tipping the economy into recession.',\n",
       "  'Given the elevated levels of uncertainty, most stocks struggled during the first five months of 2022. Year to date through May 31, the S&P 500 declined 12.8%, the Nasdaq slumped 22.8% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 8.4%. Since peaking in early January 2022, the S&P 500 was off 14%, the Nasdaq had declined 24% and the Dow was down 10% heading into June.',\n",
       "  'During the same period, the Russell 1000® Value Index (down 4.5%) outperformed the Russell 1000 Growth Index (down 21.9%) by 17.4%. Given that higher interest rates make future earnings less valuable, it was not surprising to see the value sector continue to outperform the growth sector among large cap and small cap equities, as was the case in the first quarter.',\n",
       "  'As we noted in the April issue of the Economic & Market Perspective, interest rates have been trending downward since the early 1980s, meaning that bond prices have been in a prolonged bull market. This bull market trend is continuing to reverse in 2022, as a host of crosscurrents are making for a volatile year in the U.S. bond market thus far. Year to date, interest rates across the Treasury curve increased anywhere from 60 to 182 basis points. This dramatic move comes in the wake of historically high inflation and the Fed’s pledge to combat higher prices with a series of rate hikes and balance-sheet normalization. The projected pace of monetary tightening, along with hawkish rhetoric from the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), has induced a flattening of the yield curve. The spread between 2-year Treasury and 10-year Treasury yields narrowed by 49 basis points, to just 28 basis points. Sometimes this can be a precursor for potential economic weakness. On May 5, the Fed approved a 0.50 percentage-point rate hike, the second increase this year and the largest in 22 years. This brought the Fed Funds target to a range of 0.75% to 1.00%.',\n",
       "  'Year to date, the 10-year Treasury rose 134 basis points, to 2.84%, after finishing 2021 at 1.51%. With interest rates rising aggressively, bond prices fell during the first five months of the year. The 10-year Treasury was down 10.6%, the 30-year Treasury declined 22.1%, the Bloomberg U.S. Corporate Bond Index fell 11.9% and the Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Index declined 8.9%. Although this data reflects just the first five months of 2022, it’s worth noting that bonds finished 2021 with a negative return and that it’s extremely unusual for bonds to have negative returns in back-to-back years. In fact, the last time that happened was in 1956.',\n",

It is interesting to note that 60% of the cost of gas is a function of the price of crude oil, with the other 40% coming from refining (17%), distribution and marketing (11%) and taxes (11%). As of now, it doesn’t appear that the Biden administration’s March 31 announcement that the U.S. would release one million barrels of oil per day from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve has helped to cut gas prices and fight inflation.',\n",
       "  'In addition to gas, food prices also continue to rise. The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) Economic Research Service updated its April report, which indicated that food prices continue to rise. USDA forecasts for consumer food price inflation were increased again in April, with all food prices rising 5% to 6% (compared to 4.5% to 5.5% in March) and grocery store prices expected to rise 5% to 6% (compared to 4.5% to 5.5% in March). The forecast increase in restaurant prices was held at 5.5% to 6.5%. Taking the midpoint of the USDA’s forecast ranges, all food price inflation would be at its highest point since it was 5.5% in 2008. The 20-year average for food price increases—2.4% for all food, 2.9% for restaurant prices and 2.0% for grocery store prices—means the current outlook is for costs that are at least double those averages.',\n",
       "  'On the housing front, the most recent Standard & Poor’s CoreLogic Case-Shiller Home Price Indices, from March 2022, reported a 21.2% annual gain. This was an acceleration from the December 2021 reading of 19.1%. These are very strong numbers, which will continue to keep the CPI elevated in the coming months.',\n",
       "  'At the start of 2022, commodity prices were already elevated; however, the war in Ukraine exacerbated the problem. With fears of potential supply disruption in the oil markets due to the ongoing war, crude oil prices surged above $100 per barrel for the first time since 2014. As of this writing, the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) price was $120 per barrel, and the Henry Hub Natural Gas Spot price was $9.32. To put this in perspective, natural gas was $2.91 in May 2021. Similar to gas prices for consumers, natural gas prices will start to weigh on the industrial sector—which relies on the commodity as a raw material input—as well as companies that use it as their primary energy source.',\n",
       "  'In addition, prices of the following major commodities significantly rose in the 12-month period ending June 6, 2022: aluminum (+13%); nickel (+65%); coffee (+45%); corn (+11%); wheat (+50%); sugar (+9%); and cotton (+62%). All of these are major inputs in the products Americans use every day, and consumers will continue to feel the pain of these increases as manufacturers pass the costs along in the form of higher prices.',\n",
       "  'Faced with this commodity-driven inflation spike, the Fed is now headed for its most aggressive monetary policy tightening in almost three decades. Over the past few months, the Fed has switched from an extraordinarily accommodative monetary policy to a hawkish stance. The Fed Funds Rate has increased 1.25% so far this year, and the Fed has given forward guidance that more rate hikes are coming in 2022. The market expects the Fed Funds Rate to end the year at roughly 2.75%. The Fed’s balance sheet, which has expanded to almost $9 trillion, will begin to shrink at a pace of up to $47.5 billion per month starting in June, and then double to $95 billion per month starting in September. At this point, the Fed’s main priority is to fight inflation, given its elevated level, since the labor market seems close to full employment. If inflation does not come down in the coming months, the Fed will be forced to tighten monetary policy beyond expectations, thus creating more market volatility and increasing the probability of a recession.',\n",
       "  'The first release of the U.S. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) for the first quarter of 2022 showed a decline of 1.4%, which was below expectations. While the danger of a downturn has risen as growth has slowed, most economists believe a recession in the immediate future is unlikely, given the continued strength of the job market and the more than $2 trillion in excess cash on household balance sheets.',\n",
       "  'A tight labor market should make it harder for the economy to spiral into a recession. This has the potential to give the Fed some breathing room as it embarks on its tightening cycle with the hope of guiding the economy to a soft landing that avoids a recession. In the first five months of 2022, the labor markets continued to report job growth, as they did in 2021. In the May report, nonfarm payrolls increased by 390,000, and the unemployment rate was little changed at 3.6%—just slightly above the pre-pandemic level (and a 50-year low) of 3.5% in March of 2020. The total number of unemployed people is 5.9 million, which is close to the 20-year low. (February 2020 was the low, at 5.7 million.) May’s participation rate held steady at 62.3% (the rate was at 60.2% in April of 2020) and is almost back to its 63.4% rate measured in January and February of 2020. Looking at the BLS’s Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) for April showed that the number of job openings nationwide was 11.4 million. This is an indication that the labor market is tight, with a greater supply of jobs than demand for jobs.',\n",
       "  'Investors are requiring a substantially higher risk premium due to the higher interest rates and heightened economic uncertainty. Higher rates are causing equities’ price-to-earnings (P/E) multiples to contract, as future cash flows are less valuable when discounted to their present value. This is especially true for longer-duration assets such as growth companies. Growth stocks have experienced a significant reduction in their P/E multiples. The 2023 forward multiple on the S&P 500 Index has contracted from 21.5 times at the start of the year to 16.6 times today. This is getting closer to the historic range of 14 to 15 times for forward multiples. Volatility is likely to continue as a result of decelerating earnings growth, high valuations and an interest-rate tightening cycle.',\n",
       "  'The financial markets continued to experience downward swings in prices due to the heightened level of uncertainty over the first five months of this year. As a result, the overall short-to-intermediate outlook remains uncertain, and there are several issues impacting the markets and economy worth keeping an eye on through the second half of this year. On the positive side, the country continues to see strong jobs growth, near-record-low unemployment rates, robust corporate earnings, healthy consumer spending from excess savings, and still relatively low interest rates. On the negative side, inflation continues to rise to levels not seen in decades, as supply-chain disruptions persist and the war between Russia and Ukraine intensifies. Further, rising prices for food and commodities (such as gas), as well as the Federal Reserve’s ongoing interest-rate hikes, continue to affect consumers’ purchasing power.',\n",
       "  'With all of this in mind, the Fed clearly recognizes that inflation is a major problem, and it is expected to use all the tools in its arsenal to cool the economy, engineer a soft landing and avoid a recession. We will continue to monitor this and other issues that might impact our outlook in the coming months.',\n",

       "  'The past few months have seen increasing turbulence in the financial markets as the United States economy attempts to navigate persistently high inflation, geopolitical instability from the war in Ukraine and a long-term recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. For both investors and savers, while the uncertainty and market fluctuations can be jarring, it is important not to let these—and other temporary events—influence your long-term financial planning.',\n",
       "  'Since the U.S. Federal Reserve shared plans earlier this year to implement a series of benchmark interest rate hikes during 2022, it has, in fact, done so at each of the last three Federal Open Committee Meetings. The most recent, announced on June 15, was an increase of 75 basis points—the largest rate hike since 1994. The rate and frequency of additional hikes remain to be seen, but the Fed has indicated that it is focused on bringing down the highest inflation the United States has seen in four decades, which signals that there likely is more to come. While additional interest rate hikes are now also being evaluated against the rising concern of a recession, these increases are currently viewed by the Fed as necessary to combat inflation and restore price stability—something Americans are desperately seeking—as prices continue to rise to record levels for everything from food to gas.',\n",
       "  'The European Central Bank also recently announced plans to raise its benchmark interest rates for the first time in 11 years. As inflation and geopolitical uncertainty affect international economies, it’s likely that more central banks will continue to raise interest rates to seek price stability worldwide, just as the Fed is doing here.',\n",
       "  'As the Fed continues to raise interest rates, the cost of borrowing money for consumers is becoming greater. Higher rates increase the amount of interest consumers pay on credit cards, car loans and home mortgages. As certain consumer goods and services become more costly, the rationale is that demand for them will decrease and eventually cause overall price increases to return to more typical levels and, hopefully, do so without tipping the country into an economic recession.',\n",
       "  'According to the CoreLogic Home Price Index, home prices rose 20.9% year-over-year and 3.3% from February to March, which is the fastest pace on record. This surge has potentially overvalued homes, pricing many buyers out of the market. Given the significant increase in mortgage rates that we have seen over the last few months, it is expected that the housing market may cool over the balance of the year.',\n",
       "  'Despite the recent market turbulence, the labor market has remained strong, with the Fed projecting unemployment to remain below 4% for the rest of the year. Low unemployment and a strong job market, combined with higher levels of savings remaining from many of the pandemic relief fiscal programs, should help support a rebound in consumer spending, which makes up the largest portion of the domestic economy.',\n",
       "  'As inflation rises and continues to negatively impact the spending power of consumers, market commentators have debated whether the Fed is taking the appropriate steps to combat rising prices. While it is widely acknowledged that the Fed started raising interest rates too late, it has also recently begun what’s called quantitative tightening—which is the process of shrinking the Fed’s own balance sheet by not reinvesting proceeds from maturing Treasury securities and mortgage-backed securities. Quantitative tightening and raising interest rates at the same time is a critical move for the Fed to enforce its mandate of price stability.',\n",
       "  'Despite the overwhelming and unceasing headlines around financial market volatility, inflation and higher interest rates, it’s important to remember that when it comes to saving for retirement, the best thing you can do to ensure a strong financial future is to stick to a long-term financial plan that aligns with your risk tolerance and time horizon, maintain a diversified portfolio, and don’t let market gyrations lead you astray.',\n",

       "  'In recent months, there has been a significant amount of economic uncertainty, driven primarily by inflation, which reached a 40-year high of 9.1% in June, before easing to 8.5% in July. The Federal Reserve, in an effort to combat inflation that is having an adverse impact on the economy, has been aggressively raising interest rates.',\n",
       "  'The Fed implemented 75-basis-point interest rate hikes in both June and July. The last time the Fed raised rates 75 basis points in one meeting was 1994. These two increases were in addition to 25- and 50-basis-point increases in March and May, respectively. The more aggressive hikes followed the release of the May consumer price index (CPI), which showed that prices rose 8.6% over the last 12 months—the largest increase in four decades—putting pressure on the Fed to take a more aggressive stance.',\n",
       "  \"It is our view, and the view of the markets, that the Fed will need to continue raising rates in the coming months to bring down inflation, which would put the Fed Funds target rate above 3% by the end of the year. While the interest rate increases we have seen so far have impacted both equity and fixed income markets this year, and have started to be felt in the real economy, it remains to be seen whether the Fed's efforts to combat inflation will succeed without tipping the economy into a recession.\",\n",
       "  'In the U.S. and across the globe, inflation is expected to persist at least throughout the year. Other central banks have also been raising interest rates in response. For example, the European Central Bank raised its rates by 50 basis points in July, its first hike in 11 years, and the Bank of England raised interest rates by 50 basis points earlier this month and took the unusual step of projecting a recession. It is likely that both will continue to raise interest rates throughout the remainder of the year, similar to the Fed, especially since Europe is facing higher energy costs than the U.S., given Russian restrictions on the export of natural gas.',\n",
       "  'While unemployment remains at very low levels, both here and abroad, the aggressive increases in rates in most major economies have led both the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank to lower their global growth forecasts for 2022.',\n",
       "  'The U.S. economy declined 0.9% between April and June, according to an advance estimate from the Bureau of Economic Analysis, after shrinking at an annual rate of 1.6% in the first quarter of this year. Although two consecutive quarters of negative Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is the commonly used definition of a recession, the National Bureau of Economic Research, which is officially responsible for announcing a recession, has not declared a recession, as they wait to analyze additional economic data in order to gauge how significant and widespread the decline in economic activity has been. For example, the White House Council of Economic Advisers has pointed to other key indicators, such as the continued strength of consumer spending and job growth in the first half of the year, as positive signs that the country is not in a recession.',\n",
       "  'Although the declaration of a recession always comes after the fact, it is our belief that financial markets have already priced in an economic slowdown, although they most likely have not priced in a more severe recession scenario.',\n",
       "  'Regardless of whether the country is currently in, or heading into, a recession, the short- to intermediate-term economic outlook is likely to remain murky until the path of inflation and interest rates is more clear. This could mean that stock and bond markets remain volatile over the near term, and investors should continue to monitor their portfolios to ensure that they align with their risk tolerance and investment timeline.',\n",

       "  \"Stocks and bondsStocks, or equities, as they're also called, are shares of ownership in a company. When individuals buy stocks, they become part owner in that company. Bonds, also known as fixed income, are loans that an investor makes to an issuer, such as a company or government. When individuals buy bonds, the borrowers (e.g., companies or governments) pay interest on the loan to investors until it is paid off. Stocks are historically more volatile investments than bonds but have the potential to provide greater returns over the long term, while bonds are generally considered a lower-risk investment but offer lower returns. Investing in bonds still involves risk. Bond prices generally fall when interest rates rise.Regarding your retirement plan, you probably have the option to choose from a menu of investment funds that have been selected by the plan sponsor (usually your employer). These funds invest in underlying stocks and/or bonds (or other securities) in accordance with each fund's Principal Investment Strategies.\",\n",
       "  \"Asset allocationAsset allocation is the mix of different types of investment asset classes—such as stocks, bonds and cash—in a portfolio, that can help you meet your objectives and build a financially secure retirement. To determine the asset allocation that's appropriate for you, you'll want to consider a number of factors such as your age, investment goals and tolerance for risk when it comes to investing. For help as you identify the asset allocation that aligns with your long-term investment objectives, check out Mutual of America's Investment Questionnaire.\",\n",
       "  \"DiversificationDiversification is the strategy of having investments in various asset classes and different types of markets, sectors, industries and securities so your exposure to a single area of the market is limited. Think of the phrase: Don't put all your eggs in one basket. Diversification can further reduce risk and volatility in your retirement account over time, while also helping you with your asset allocation decisions. With a properly diversified portfolio, when one area of the market declines, the rest of your portfolio's value would still be relatively insulated by your investments in other areas. It is important to note that diversification does not guarantee investment returns or eliminate the risk of loss.\",\n",

       "  'Some days it may feel as if investing is like a rollercoaster ride filled with many highs and lows. So when the stock market experiences volatility—or rapid fluctuations up and down in stock prices—the good news is that having a diverse portfolio and staying invested over the long term can help your portfolio weather these uncertain times.* As you focus on safeguarding your financial future, here are a few tips to consider when navigating volatility.',\n",
       "  'An important first step is to ensure you have a diversified portfolio spread across stocks (also known as equities) and bonds, and even cash equivalents. Commit to reviewing the plan at least annually to make sure your asset allocation continues to reflect your age, risk tolerance, expected retirement date and any major lifestyle shifts. This will help you to withstand ups and downs in the market in the short term, while keeping your retirement savings on track in the long term.',\n",
       "  \"While it might be tempting to shift your asset allocation to a more conservative mix as market volatility increases, nobody can predict when markets will reverse course. By trying to time the stock market to avoid potential losses, you run the risk of hurting your portfolio's long-term performance and missing out on the chance for your savings to grow and benefit when the market recovers.\",\n",
       "  'Reducing your regular retirement contributions during periods of volatility may also seem like a good way to protect your portfolio, but it can have the opposite effect. Not only will you save less, your earnings will not have the opportunity to compound as much over time. Maintaining consistent contributions through market ups and downs can help your retirement savings continue to grow over time.',\n",

The conversion of assets from a Traditional IRA to a Roth IRA can only be done on a taxable basis. Therefore, ordinary income taxes must be paid on the portion of the \"Traditional,\" or \"regular,\" IRA that is taxable.As part of the conversion, individuals will have to pay income taxes on the taxable amount, if any, of the Traditional IRA converted to a Roth IRA. The taxable amount includes earnings plus deductible contributions. Additionally, they must decide whether or not to pay the income tax owed on the conversion with the proceeds of the IRA being converted or from another source. Rollovers must also be completed within 60 days of the distribution from the Traditional IRA.The five-year period for which Roth IRAs must be held before qualified tax-free distributions can be made will apply separately to regular Roth IRA contributions, and to conversions or rollovers to Roth IRAs. Withdrawals from converted or rollover amounts within five years of the conversion or rollover are subject to a penalty tax, even if not taxable. As a result, it is strongly suggested that you avoid commingling regular Roth IRA contributions with conversion/rollover contributions in one tax year with similar contributions in different tax years. It is recommended that a separate Roth IRA be established for each year.',\n",

       "  'The accumulation period refers to the time during which your retirement savings accumulate in a deferred annuity. Because annuities are federal income tax deferred, all earnings are reinvested to increase the base on which future earnings accumulate, so you have the benefit of compounding.When you buy a deferred fixed annuity contract, the company issuing the contract promises a fixed rate of return during the accumulation period regardless of whether market interest rates move up or down. With a deferred variable annuity, the amount you accumulate during the accumulation period depends on the performance of the separate account funds you select from among those offered in the contract, in addition to the rate of interest credited from time to time on any amounts that may have be allocated to the Interest Accumulation Account.At the end of the accumulation period, you can choose to annuitize, agree to some other method of receiving income, or roll over your account value into an immediate annuity. The years in which you receive annuity income are sometimes called the distribution period.',\n",
       "  \"Accumulation units are the shares you own in the separate account funds of a variable annuity during the period you're putting money into your annuity. If you own the annuity in a 401(k) plan, each time you make a contribution, that amount is added to one or more of the separate account funds to buy additional accumulation units.The value of your annuity is figured by multiplying the number of units you own by the dollar value of each unit. During the accumulation phase, that value changes to reflect the changing performance of the underlying investments in the separate account funds.\",\n",
       "  'Your AGI is your gross, or total, income from taxable sources minus certain deductions. Income includes salary and other employment income, interest and dividends, and long- and short-term capital gains and losses. Deductions include unreimbursed business and medical expenses, contributions to a deductible individual retirement annuity (IRA), and alimony you pay.You figure your AGI on page one of your federal tax return, and it serves as the basis for calculating the income tax you owe. Your modified AGI is used to establish your eligibility for certain tax or financial benefits, such as deducting your IRA contribution or qualifying for certain tax credits.',\n",
       "  \"When a company based overseas wants to sell its shares in the US markets, it can offer them through a US bank, which is known as the depositary. The depositary bank holds the issuing company's shares, known as American depositary shares (ADSs), and offers them to investors as certificates known as American depositary receipts (ADRs). Each ADR represents a specific number of shares.ADRs are quoted in US dollars and trade on US markets just like ordinary shares. While hundreds are listed on the major exchanges, the majority are traded over the counter, usually because they're too small to meet exchange listing requirements.\",\n",
       "  'Amortization is the gradual repayment of a debt over a period of time, such as monthly payments on a mortgage loan or credit card balance. To amortize a loan, your payments must be large enough to pay not only the interest that has accrued but also to reduce the principal you owe.',\n",
       "  \"A loan's annual percentage rate, or APR, is what credit costs you each year, expressed as a percentage of the loan amount. The APR, which is usually higher than the nominal, or named, rate you're quoted for a loan, includes most of a loan's up-front fees as well as the annual interest rate.\\xa0You should use APR, which is a more accurate picture of the cost of borrowing than the interest rate alone, to compare various loans you're considering.\",\n",
       "  \"When you annuitize, you choose to convert the assets in your deferred annuity or other retirement savings account into a stream of regular income payments that are guaranteed to last for your lifetime or the combined lifetimes of yourself and another person, called your joint annuitant. You typically annuitize when you retire. But, if you own a nonqualified annuity, you may begin receiving income at 59½ without risking an early withdrawal penalty, or you can postpone the decision to annuitize well beyond normal retirement age.One reason people may give for choosing not to annuitize is that they're afraid if they die shortly after they begin receiving payments, they will forfeit a large portion of the annuity's value. To avoid that situation, some people choose to annuitize with what's called a period certain payout guaranteeing that they or their beneficiaries will receive income for at least a minimum period, typically 5, 10, or 20 years.You should be aware that the promise to pay lifetime income is contingent on the claims-paying ability of the company providing the annuity contract. That's why you'll want to check the ratings that independent analysts give your annuity company before you annuitize your contract.\",\n",
       "  \"Originally, an annuity simply meant an annual payment. That's why the retirement income you receive from a defined benefit plan each year, usually in monthly installments, is called a pension annuity. But an annuity is also an insurance company product that's designed to allow you to accumulate tax-deferred assets that can be converted to a source of lifetime annual income.When a deferred annuity is offered as part of a qualified plan, such as a traditional 401(k), 403(b), or tax-deferred annuity (TDA), you can contribute up to the annual limit and typically begin to take income from the annuity when you retire. You can also buy a nonqualified deferred annuity contract on your own. With nonqualified annuities, there are no federal limits on annual contributions and no required withdrawals, though you may begin receiving income without penalty when you turn 59½.An immediate annuity, in contrast, is one you purchase with a lump sum when you are ready to begin receiving income, usually when you retire. The payouts begin right away and the annuity company promises the income will last your lifetime.With all types of annuities, the guarantee of lifetime annuity income depends on the claims-paying ability of the company that sells the annuity contract.\",\n",
       "  \"The annuity principal is the sum of money you use to buy an annuity and the base on which annuity earnings accumulate. If you're buying a deferred annuity, you may make a one-time — or single premium — purchase, or you may build your annuity principal with a series of regular or intermittent payments. For example, if you own an annuity in an employer sponsored retirement plan, you add to your principal each time you defer some of your income into your account — typically every time you're paid. When you buy an immediate annuity, you commit your annuity principal as a lump sum, and that amount is one of the key factors that determines the amount of your annuity income.\",\n",
       "  \"When an asset such as stock, real estate, or personal property increases in value without any improvements or modification having been made to it, that's called appreciation. Some personal assets, such as fine art or antiques, may appreciate over time, while others - such as electronic equipment - usually lose value, or depreciate. Certain investments also have the potential to appreciate. A number of factors can cause an asset to appreciate, among them inflation, uniqueness, or increased demand.\",\n",
       "  'Assets are everything you own that has any monetary value, plus any money you are owed. They include money in bank accounts, stocks, bonds, mutual funds, equity in real estate, the value of your life insurance policy, and any personal property that people would pay to own. When you figure your net worth, you subtract the amount you owe, or your liabilities, from your assets. Similarly, a company’s assets include the value of its physical plant, its inventory, and intangible assets, such as its reputation.',\n",
       "  \"Asset allocation is a strategy, advocated by modern portfolio theory, for reducing risk in your investment portfolio in order to maximize return. Specifically, asset allocation means dividing your assets among different broad categories of investments, called asset classes. Stocks, bonds and cash are examples of asset classes, as are real estate and derivatives such as options and futures contracts.Most financial services firms suggest particular asset allocations for specific groups of clients and fine-tune those allocations for individual investors. The asset allocation model - specifically the percentages of your investment principal allocated to each investment category you're using - that's appropriate for you at any given time depends on many factors, such as the goals you're investing to achieve, how much time you have to invest, your tolerance for risk, the direction of interest rates, and the market outlook.Ideally, you adjust or rebalance your portfolio from time to time to bring the allocation back in line with the model you've selected. Or, you might realign your model as your financial goals, your time frame, or the market situation changes.\",\n",
       "  \"Different categories of investments are described as asset classes.\\xa0 Stocks, bonds, and cash — including cash equivalents — are major asset classes. So are real estate, derivative investments, such as options and futures contracts, and precious metals.When you allocate the assets in your investment portfolio, you decide what proportion of its total value will be invested in each of the different asset classes you're including.\",\n",

Starting in 2010, all IRA owners and participants in eligible employer-sponsored plans, regardless of their income level, are eligible to convert their traditional IRA and pretax funds in an employer-sponsored plan [401(k), 401(a), 403(b) and government 457(b)] to a Roth IRA.Is this a good option for you? A conversion has both advantages and disadvantages that should be carefully considered before you make a decision. This calculator compares two alternatives with equal out-of-pocket costs to estimate the change in total net worth at retirement if you convert your traditional IRA into a Roth IRA.',\n",

All contributions to a Roth IRA must be made on an after-tax basis. For single taxpayers with an AGI between $138,000 and $153,000, the maximum allowable contribution to a Roth IRA is proportionally reduced. Unlike other types of IRAs, there is no age requirement to begin taking distributions and contributions can be made as long as the taxpayer has earned income. Withdrawals of after-tax contributions are not subject to federal income taxes, and withdrawals of interest and investment earnings can be tax-free if taken at least five years after the first contribution and after reaching age 59½, or for qualified reasons such as a first-time home purchase, death or disability, or expenses related to the birth or adoption of a child.\\n\\nContext excerpts:\\n- \"Eligibility to make contributions to a Roth IRA is limited by income and filing status.\"\\n- \"All contributions to a Roth IRA are made on an after-tax basis.\"\\n- \"For single taxpayers with an AGI between $138,000 and $153,000, the maximum allowable contribution to a Roth IRA is proportionately reduced.\"\\n- \"With a Roth IRA, unlike other types of IRAs, you are not required to begin taking a distribution at any specific age, and you can continue to make contributions as long as you have earned income.\"\\n- \"Withdrawals of your after-tax contributions are not subject to federal income taxes.\"\\n- \"Withdrawals of your interest and any investment earnings are not subject to federal income taxes if taken at least five years after you first contribute to your Roth IRA, and you have attained age 59½; or withdrawals for a qualified first-time home purchase (up to a $10,000 maximum lifetime limit); as a result of your death or disability, or up to $5,000 to pay for expenses related to the birth or adoption of your child.\"'"
