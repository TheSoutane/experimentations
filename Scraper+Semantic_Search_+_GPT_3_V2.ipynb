       "  \"Over time, the Retirement Funds' mix of investment allocations (equities, fixed income and money market funds) will change based on a predetermined strategy. Generally, except for the Retirement Income Fund, the more time that remains until a target-date Retirement Fund approaches its target retirement date, the more emphasis that Fund will place on achieving capital appreciation by investing more heavily in equity funds.\",\n",
       "  'Alternatively, the less time that remains until a target-date Retirement Fund approaches its target retirement date, the more emphasis that Fund will place on preserving capital while also seeking to produce income, by investing more in fixed income and short-term investments.',\n",
       "  'As each target-date Retirement Fund approaches its target retirement year, Mutual of America Capital Management LLC, the Adviser, will periodically reallocate and change the mix of Mutual of America Capital Management LLC Funds to gradually move toward an objective of capital preservation and income production.',\n",
       "  \"Unlike the target-date Retirement Funds, the mix of investments in the Retirement Income Fund is not expected to change over time. The Retirement Income Fund is intended for investors who have passed their retirement date and seek a mix of investments more geared toward the objective of preserving capital and producing income than that offered by other Retirement Funds. From the period of time remaining until a Retirement Fund's target retirement date, current market conditions, the economy, unanticipated events and other factors may affect the periodic reallocation of each Retirement Fund's assets.\",\n",
       "  'The Retirement Funds are expected to be rebalanced periodically, approximately on a quarterly basis. The mix of Funds within each Retirement Fund is expected to be reviewed at least annually.',\n",
       "  'Many investors can expect to live for a significant time period after retirement. Although capital preservation becomes a primary consideration in retirement, growth is also an important consideration to help offset the negative impact of inflation.',\n",
       "  'As a result, a Retirement Fund that has reached its target retirement date may have as much as 45% of its assets invested in equities.',\n",
       "  'Such a maturing Retirement Fund will move toward the allocation mix of the Retirement Income Fund over the 10-year period after the retirement year has been attained.',\n",
