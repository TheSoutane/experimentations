Each year, the Mutual of America Foundation sponsors a national competition in which hundreds of organizations demonstrate the value of their partnership to the communities they serve, their ability to be replicated by others and their capacity to stimulate new approaches to addressing significant social issues. Six organizations are selected by an independent committee to receive the Community Partnership Award.  The Thomas J. Moran Award is given to the national award-winning program and includes $100,000 and a documentary video about the program.', 'The Frances R. Hesselbein Award is given to a partnership that is addressing social challenges in more than one community, or which demonstrates the potential to be replicated in other communities. This recipient receives $50,000. Four other organizations are named Honorable Mention recipients for their programs, and each receives $50,000.  Since its inception in 1996, the Community Partnership Award has recognized 256 partnerships from cities and towns across America. Like so many of our clients working in the nonprofit community, Mutual of America is dedicated to having a direct, positive impact on society. The 2023 Community Partnership Award competition is open. Apply today! The deadline is July 1, 2023.     Ms. Lisa M.

Such plans are designed to address significant business disruptions of varying scope.', ""In the event that a disaster affects the Company's New York Home Office, prompt resumption of operations would occur by utilizing the Company's Regional Offices in the Northeast and the Mutual of America National Telecommunications and Conference Center in Boca Raton, Florida. These facilities have been configured to perform processing and to handle communications that usually involve the Home Office without the need to acquire additional processing equipment or personnel. The disaster recovery plans are intended to provide continuous account access and transaction support during the disruption in normal operations at any of the Mutual of America facilities. The disaster recovery plans include the Mutual of America National Telecommunications and Conference Center, Boca Raton, Florida, utilizing a site outside of the State of Florida in the event of a disaster that affects Boca Raton. Data processing and telecommunications operations are planned to resume within 24 hours of our inability to utilize the Boca Raton facility. On a daily basis, backup files from the Company's computer systems are sent to an off-site secure location. These backup files would be used at the off-site location as part of the disaster recovery plans. You can be assured that the disaster recovery plans are reviewed as necessary and tested at least annually to ensure that we have taken the steps within our control to limit any impact to providing services to our clients during all types of business disruptions.                              © Copyright 1999-2023 Mutual of America Life Insurance Company.

What are Section 457 Deferred Compensation Plans?       There are two types of Section 457(b) plans:  Governmental 457(b) – offered by governmental entities to all employees. These plans are very similar to qualified defined contribution plans, like 401(k) and 403(b) plans. Nongovernmental 457(b) – offered by tax-exempt employers to a select group of management or highly compensated employees.

You should consider the investment objectives, risks, and charges and expenses of the investment funds and, if applicable, the variable annuity contract, carefully before investing. This and other information is contained in the funds' prospectuses and summary prospectuses and the contract prospectus or brochure, if applicable, which can be obtained by calling 800.468.3785 or visiting mutualofamerica.com. Read them carefully before investing.  1 Pursuant to DOL regulations, QDIAs are default investments that, if used by defined contribution plans, profit-sharing plans, and 401(k) and 403(b) plans, the plan fiduciary may not incur liability for investment losses as a result of investing participant elective deferrals\xa0in such investments without an affirmative deferral election or investment election from the participant.↵ 2 Minimum employer contributions: Employer Non-Matching is 3% of employee’s compensation. Employer Matching is at least 100% of the first 1% and 50% of the next 5% of compensation deferred by the employee. Maximum employer match is 6%.↵ 3 For QACAs, the minimum default deferral percentage cannot be less than 3% during the first full plan year, 4% during the second plan year, 5% during the third plan year and 6% thereafter. Maximum deferral percentage is 15% (e.g., if an employee is hired in April of the current plan year, they would be subject to the 3% deferral percentage for the remainder of the current plan year as well as the following plan year).↵ 4 For EACAs and QACAs, participants may be able to opt-out and withdraw deferrals made by automatic contribution (plus or minus earnings) without penalty for up to 90 days after the date of the first automatic deferral.↵  5 Employee elective deferrals are always 100% vested.↵"", ""6 For purposes of the notice that must be provided to eligible employees, Mutual of America will provide such notice on behalf of plan sponsors using our mutual fund/trust platform.

Charitable organizations Civic leagues Home healthcare providers Social welfare organizations Religious and apostolic associations  Tax-Deferred Savings Potential Thanks to tax-deferred savings potential, employees may max out their contributions to both the Eligible Deferred Compensation Plan and their existing qualified plan, potentially doubling their savings.* Special 457(b) catch-up contributions can help employees save even more as they near retirement age. Additionally, enhance your employees’ retirement planning choices by offering them the additional option to make Designated Roth 403(b) contributions on an after-tax basis under your retirement plan. *Participation in a 457(b) plan is limited to a select group of management or highly compensated employees to meet the “top hat” exception under ERISA. All deferrals remain an asset of the employer, subject to the claims of its general creditors, until they are distributed or made available to the employee. Generally, amounts made available to the employee under the plan are subject to income tax at the employee's ordinary income tax rate at the time made available. Dedicated Local Support Mutual of America representatives can conduct virtual and/or on-site group and individual meetings with your employees to explain the benefits of the plan, the value a retirement plan can deliver over time and how they can enroll.

Important information about IRA contribution limits.', ""Your contributions to an IRA are subject to annual limits imposed by the Internal Revenue Code, which may change for future years. (The limits do not apply to rollover contributions, and higher limits apply to employee contributions to a SIMPLE IRA plan offered through an employer.) You should ensure that the automatic contributions you request are within those annual limits for this year, and you should review your automatic contributions at the end of each year to be sure you continue to be eligible and to review the applicable limits for the next year. Additional information, including the limits for the current year, is available on our website for IRAs and Roth IRAs. To more fully understand the tax and planning considerations, including laws specific to your state, you should consult a tax adviser. To speak with a Mutual of America representative, please contact your local office or call 800.468.3785.

The value of a variable annuity contract will fluctuate depending on the performance of the Separate Account investment options you choose.

Managing your savings to provide the income you will need during retirement requires the same kind of planning for the future. Mutual of America is ready to help with the assistance you need when you are ready to retire and throughout your retirement years. We can help you make the change from receiving a paycheck, to relying on your savings for retirement income. Mutual of America offers flexibility and a variety of options for withdrawing your money based on your specific needs for retirement income. Our Participant Account Representatives and Rollover Specialists can help you review the retirement income options available through a Mutual of America:  Flexible Premium Annuity (FPA) Individual Retirement Annuity (Traditional IRA)"", ""Roth Individual Retirement Annuity (Roth IRA)  Replacing the steady stream of income from your paycheck requires managing and coordinating the sources of retirement income available to you, including your savings, and any other sources, such as Social Security and employer-sponsored retirement plans. You'll have to consider how and when the income will be paid and estimate the amount of monthly income you will need to live on. You will also have to make choices that can determine whether your retirement income will last through your retirement years, and if you leave a death benefit for your beneficiaries. With your retirement savings under the contracts shown above, you can:  Receive a lump-sum payment of your account value or make withdrawals from your contract as you need the money; or Receive regular monthly payments from your contract with our Specified Payments Option (SPO), and continue to manage and have full access to your retirement savings; or Choose one of our guaranteed income annuities, to receive a guaranteed monthly income for life, with some options providing death benefits for your beneficiary.  If you choose a guaranteed monthly income for life option, payments under the annuity are guaranteed by, and subject to, the financial strength and claims-paying ability of Mutual of America Life Insurance Company. No matter which option you choose, you can elect to have your funds paid to you through the security and convenience of electronic funds transfer (EFT).       Important Information Regarding Withdrawals      For an FPA, withdrawals of the tax-deferred interest and any investment earnings are subject to income tax at your ordinary income tax rate at the time of withdrawal, and if made prior to age 59½, a 10% federal tax penalty, unless another exception applies."", ""For IRAs (except Roth), withdrawals are subject to income tax at your ordinary income tax rate at the time of withdrawal, and if made prior to age 59½, a 10% federal tax penalty, unless another exception applies. For Roth IRAs, withdrawals of your after-tax contributions are not subject to federal income taxes. And, you won't have to pay federal income taxes on withdrawals of your interest and any investment earnings if taken at least five years after you first contribute to your Roth IRA, and you have attained age 59½; or withdrawals for a qualified first-time home purchase (up to a $10,000 maximum lifetime limit); as a result of your death or disability, or up to $5,000 to pay for expenses related to the birth or adoption of your child.       The Retirement Income Choices Available to You at Mutual of America Are Explained in More Detail Below.       Lump-Sum Payment Option – Choose this option if you would like to receive a single payment of your account value. Or, you can keep your contract in place and elect to make periodic withdrawals as you need the funds.  Specified Payments Option (Your Most Flexible Option) – The Specified Payments Option (SPO) allows you to receive regular monthly payments as an alternative to using your account value to purchase a guaranteed lifetime income annuity once you reach retirement age.  By choosing the Specified Payments Option, you can:  Receive regular monthly payments as withdrawals from your account value, without having to give up control of your savings; Continue to manage your account value, asset allocations, withdrawals and the timing of your withdrawals for tax purposes; Name beneficiaries while you maintain your contract and manage your withdrawals, so you can leave your remaining account value to your beneficiaries;"", 'If you qualify, continue to make contributions to your FPA, Roth IRA or Traditional IRA1 while you are receiving payments from the account, to help generate additional income during your retirement or to leave a death benefit for your beneficiaries.2  Choose the Amount and Withdrawal Method of Your SPO Payments You can choose when to begin, stop or change the amount of your SPO monthly payments of $100 or more at any time. Please note, however, that withdrawals made prior to age 59½ may be subject to a 10% federal tax penalty unless you meet an exception in the tax code.3 SPO payments may be withdrawn on a pro rata basis (proportionately) from the Interest Accumulation Account and/or Separate Account investment fund(s) based on the amount that you have allocated to each at the time of payment. You may also receive your monthly SPO payments from the Interest Accumulation Account and/or investment fund(s) you select. You may change your elections whenever you wish. We encourage you to sign up for Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) to have your SPO payments deposited directly to your bank account. You will continue to receive quarterly statements showing all SPO transactions affecting your account, and you can continue to view your account information online at mutualofamerica.com and our mobile site. You also retain the right to transfer amounts among the Interest Accumulation Account and/or investment funds and to change the allocation of your future contributions. Please note that if you elect the SPO, you reduce the overall account value of the contract from which payments are being withdrawn, and there is no guarantee that you will have sufficient account value to continue payments for any period. Also, individuals should consider the possible federal income tax consequences of electing the SPO.   Guaranteed Lifetime Income Annuities', 'If you are like many people in or near retirement, you may want the financial security and stability that a guaranteed monthly income for life can provide. With your Mutual of America annuity, the amount of your guaranteed monthly income is based on your account value at the time you elect a lifetime income annuity, the form of monthly income payments you choose and whether you elect to provide the possibility of a death benefit for your beneficiaries.       Mutual of America offers the following forms of guaranteed lifetime income annuities:      Non-Refund Life Annuity  You will receive monthly payments for life. All payments cease upon your death.  Full Cash Refund Annuity  You will receive monthly payments for life. If your death occurs before your benefit payments equal your total account value when you began to receive annuity payments, your beneficiary will receive the balance of that value in a single sum.  Life Annuity with Period Certain Annuity  You will receive monthly payments for life. You may choose a 36-, 60-, 120- or 180-month guarantee. If your death occurs before you have received all of the guaranteed monthly payments as selected, the same monthly benefit will continue to your beneficiary until the total number of payments selected have been made.  Joint and Survivor Life Annuity  You will receive monthly payments for life. You may choose a survivorship percentage of 50%, 66⅔%, 75% or 100%. After your death, if your joint annuitant is still alive, your joint annuitant will receive monthly payments for life equal to that elected percentage of your original monthly payment amount. Payments will end upon the death of the last survivor.  Joint and Survivor with Period Certain Annuity  You will receive monthly payments for life.', 'You may choose a survivorship percentage of 50%, 66⅔%, 75% or 100%. After your death, if your joint annuitant is still alive, your joint annuitant will receive monthly payments for life equal to that elected percentage of your original monthly payment amount.  You may also choose a 36-, 60-, 120- or 180-month period certain guarantee. If both you and your joint annuitant die before the period certain elected, your beneficiary will receive monthly payments (in the amount paid to the last surviving annuitant) until the period ends.          All annuity payments are subject to the financial strength and claims-paying ability of Mutual of America Life Insurance Company, which continues to be rated among the strongest companies in the life insurance industry by the major independent rating agencies.4\xa0These current ratings are available at\xa0mutualofamerica.com/ratings. Once your guaranteed lifetime income annuity payments begin, you cannot change your payment form or your joint annuitant. If your monthly annuity benefit would be less than $50 ($20 per month for certain older contracts), we may elect to pay your benefit in a single-sum payment. We can provide you with an estimate of the guaranteed monthly income you would receive under the various annuity options we offer, to help you choose the one that best meets your needs.       Minimum Distribution Requirements      For all contracts except FPAs and Roth IRAs, IRS regulations require that you begin to receive your retirement benefit no later than April 1 of the calendar year following the calendar year in which you attained age 72. With a Roth IRA, unlike other types of IRAs, you are not required to begin taking a distribution at any specific age, and you can continue to make contributions as long as you have earned income. Mandatory distributions are only required to be made after the death of the Roth IRA contractholder.', ""In general, these regulations provide that your entire retirement benefit must be distributed over a period that does not exceed your life expectancy or the joint life expectancy of you and your beneficiary. Please consult with your tax adviser for more information.

You can also get started by estimating your retirement income with our easy-to-use Retirement Income calculator.      You should consider the investment objectives, risks, and charges and expenses of the variable annuity contract and the underlying investment funds carefully before investing. This and other information is contained in the contract prospectus and underlying funds prospectuses and summary prospectuses, which can be obtained by calling 800.468.3785 or visiting mutualofamerica.com. Read them carefully before investing.   Mutual of America's Flexible Premium Annuity (FPA) and Individual Retirement Annuities (IRAs) are individual variable annuity contracts and are suitable for long-term investing, particularly for retirement savings. The value of a variable annuity contract will fluctuate depending on the performance of the Separate Account investment funds you choose. Upon redemption, you could receive more or less than the principal amount invested. A variable annuity contract provides no additional tax-deferred treatment of benefits beyond the treatment provided to any IRA by applicable tax law. You should consider a variable annuity contract's other features before making a decision. 1You can only contribute to a Roth IRA or Traditional IRA to the extent you have earned income.↵"", ""2Death benefits from your FPA or IRA are subject to federal and state income tax to the same extent as would be taxable to you.↵ 3For an FPA, withdrawals of the tax-deferred interest and any investment earnings are subject to income tax at your ordinary income tax rate at the time of withdrawal, and if made prior to age 59½, a 10% federal tax penalty. For IRAs (except Roth), withdrawals are subject to income tax at your ordinary income tax rate at the time of withdrawal, and if made prior to age 59½, a 10% federal tax penalty. For Roth IRAs, withdrawals of your after-tax contributions are not subject to federal income taxes. And, you won't have to pay federal income taxes on withdrawals of your interest and any investment earnings if taken at least five years after a contribution is made, starting with the year in which a contribution is made, and you have attained age 59½; or withdrawals for a qualified first-time home purchase (up to a $10,000 maximum lifetime limit); or as a result of your death or disability.↵ 4While these ratings do not apply to the safety or investment performance of the Separate Account investment funds available under Mutual of America's products, they do reflect the Company's ability to fulfill its General Account obligations, which include its obligations under the Interest Accumulation Account, annuity purchase rate guarantees and annuity benefit payouts, as well as life insurance and disability income payments.

If you will be retiring or leaving employment soon, you may want to transfer or ""roll over"" your assets from a qualified retirement plan to our IRA variable annuity contract. Before rolling over funds from plans with other providers, you should review the accounts you have with them to determine the fees and expenses you currently pay and whether there are any surrender charges that may result and to ensure that it is in your best interest to roll over your other accounts to a Rollover\xa0IRA.        If you\'re retiring', ""If you will soon be retiring, and you plan to withdraw your money from your employer's pension or retirement plan, you may be able to roll over your benefit to an IRA. An IRA allows you to defer federal income taxes on the rollover amount. Any interest and investment earnings will also accumulate free from federal income taxes until withdrawn. Withdrawals are subject to income tax at your ordinary income tax rate at the time of withdrawal, and if made prior to age 59½, a 10% federal tax\xa0penalty unless another exception applies.       If you're leaving your current job      If you're not retiring, but you will soon be leaving your current employer, you may be able to roll over the assets in your current retirement plan to an IRA when you leave. Rolling over your retirement plan assets to an IRA allows you to continue to defer federal income taxes and avoid the 10% early withdrawal penalty if you are under age 59½ or another exception applies. In addition, interest and investment earnings will continue to accumulate free from federal income tax until\xa0withdrawn.       If you want to change IRA providers      You can transfer from another Traditional IRA (with another provider) to Mutual of America's IRA and continue to enjoy federal income tax deferral on any interest and investment\xa0earnings.       Direct transfers      If you already have a Traditional IRA with another financial institution, you may be able to make a nontaxable direct transfer to a Mutual of America\xa0IRA.       Long-term tax advantages      All of the interest and/or investment earnings credited to your account accumulate tax-deferred until they are\xa0withdrawn.       Single-sum distributions"", ""If, instead of a direct rollover, you take a single-sum distribution of your retirement assets, 20% will automatically be deducted for mandatory withholding tax. If you're under age 59½, you'll also pay a 10% early withdrawal penalty and regular income tax on the amount received. Provided the rollover is made within 60 days of the distribution, it will not be currently taxable. Learn more about\xa0Features & Benefits.

A Rollover IRA is a variable annuity contract and is issued on Form 3814-IRA or a similar form specific to your state of residence. In the states of Maine, Oregon and Utah, the variable annuity contract is issued on Form IRA-2004 or a similar form specific to your state of residence. This contract does not provide additional income-tax deferral advantages beyond those available in an IRA. You should carefully consider an annuity contract's other features before making a decision, as well as the potential for a loss of account value due to the Rollover IRA's variable investment\xa0choices.   You should consider the investment objectives, risks, and charges and expenses of the variable annuity contract and the underlying investment funds carefully before investing.

The Mutual of America Roth IRA is a type of individual retirement variable annuity contract that generally allows you to receive distributions on a tax-free basis. The Roth IRA does not provide up-front income tax deductions for contributions, like there can be with a Traditional IRA. All contributions to a Roth IRA are made on an after-tax basis, but the Roth IRA provides the opportunity for tax-free investment earnings and tax-free distributions if qualified distributions are made.Unlike other types of IRAs, you are not required to begin taking a distribution at any specific age, and you can continue to make contributions as long as you have earned income, even after age 70½. Mandatory distributions are only required to be made after the death of the Roth IRA contractholder.        Am I eligible for a Roth IRA?       Single taxpayers with a modified Adjusted Gross Income (AGI)* of $138,000 or less in 2023 can contribute up to $6,500 per year.', 'For single taxpayers with an AGI between $138,000 and $153,000, the maximum allowable contribution to a Roth IRA is proportionately reduced. Single taxpayers with an AGI of $153,000 or more in 2023 may not contribute. Married taxpayers filing joint tax returns with a modified AGI of $218,000 or less in 2023 can contribute up to $6,500 each per year, even if only one spouse has compensation. For married taxpayers filing joint returns with a modified AGI between $218,000 and $228,000 for 2023, the maximum allowable contribution to the Roth IRA is proportionately reduced. Married taxpayers filing joint returns with an AGI of more than $228,000 in 2023 may not contribute to a Roth IRA. Married taxpayers filing separate returns cannot contribute to a Roth IRA.  *The modified AGI is used for calculating Roth IRA contribution limits. Please refer to Internal Revenue Code Publication 590 or consult with your tax adviser.       How much may I contribute to a Roth IRA?      The maximum contribution in 2023 is the lesser of $6,500 or 100% of your compensation if you are single, or the lesser of $6,500 for each spouse or 100% of your combined compensation if you are a married couple filing jointly. Both maximums apply to an individual\'s total contributions to all Roth IRAs (except rollovers) and are reduced by any contributions you may have made to any other types of IRAs. The annual dollar limitation increase for 2023 and subsequent years is $6,500, indexed for inflation in $500 increments. Rules limiting Roth IRA contributions based on the modified AGI apply. REMINDER:\xa0Indexing does not automatically increase the limit each year; increases only apply when the inflation-adjusted limit equals or exceeds the next incremental amount.

Age 50 ""catch-up"" contributions', ""Catch-up contributions allow individuals who have reached age 50 to contribute an additional amount to their IRA in that year. In 2023, the catch-up amount is $1,000. Thus, for example, the IRA contribution limits for 2023 are:  $6,500 for individuals under age 50. $7,500 for individuals age 50 or older.

When can I contribute?      You may make contributions for a tax year up to the due date for filing income tax returns for that specific year, generally April 15th of the following year.       Withdrawals—what is a qualified distribution?      A qualified distribution is a distribution that is made:  At least five taxable years after a contribution is made, starting with the year in which a contribution is made, and on or after attainment of age 59½, or for a qualified first-time home purchase of up to a $10,000 maximum lifetime limit. As a result of death or disability.', ""All other withdrawals are considered taxable as ordinary income and may also be subject to a 10% premature distribution federal tax penalty to the extent attributable to the Roth IRA's investment earnings, unless an exception applies. A list of exceptions can be found on the IRS website:\xa0irs.gov. Please note, however, that after-tax Roth IRA contributions are considered to be withdrawn first.

The conversion of assets from a Traditional IRA to a Roth IRA can only be done on a taxable basis. Therefore, ordinary income taxes must be paid on the portion of the ""Traditional,"" or ""regular,"" IRA that is taxable.As part of the conversion, individuals will have to pay income taxes on the taxable amount, if any, of the Traditional IRA converted to a Roth IRA. The taxable amount includes earnings plus deductible contributions. Additionally, they must decide whether or not to pay the income tax owed on the conversion with the proceeds of the IRA being converted or from another source. Rollovers must also be completed within 60 days of the distribution from the Traditional IRA.The five-year period for which Roth IRAs must be held before qualified tax-free distributions can be made will apply separately to regular Roth IRA contributions, and to conversions or rollovers to Roth IRAs. Withdrawals from converted or rollover amounts within five years of the conversion or rollover are subject to a penalty tax, even if not taxable. As a result, it is strongly suggested that you avoid commingling regular Roth IRA contributions with conversion/rollover contributions in one tax year with similar contributions in different tax years. It is recommended that a separate Roth IRA be established for each year.

When you leave your employer, you may be able to roll your retirement plan savings to a Mutual of America IRA. If you receive a distribution from an IRA, a qualified pension or profit-sharing plan or a tax-deferred annuity plan, you may be able to roll over the distribution to a Mutual of America IRA. Provided the rollover is made within 60 days of the distribution, it will not be currently taxable. Distributions not handled by means of a direct rollover to a Traditional IRA are subject to mandatory 20% federal tax withholding. For more information about rolling over to a new Traditional IRA, refer to the\xa0Rollover\xa0IRA. Before rolling over funds from plans with other providers, you should review the accounts you have with them to determine the fees and expenses you currently pay and whether there are any surrender charges that may result and to ensure that it is in your best interest to roll over your other accounts to a Mutual of America IRA.       What are your payment options?      When you are ready to start receiving benefit payments from your account, you have the following options:  Specified Payments Option (SPO) – This option allows you to receive regular monthly payments from your account. The SPO payment amount ($100 minimum) can be changed or stopped at any time. Annuity – All forms of annuities available under the plan provide a monthly benefit to you for life. The amount of your monthly annuity income will depend on the annuity you select. You may start receiving annuity payments as early as age 55. Single Sum – You may withdraw your account balance in a single sum.  Mutual of America offers a variety of options for withdrawing your money, based on your specific needs for retirement income.

accumulation period refers to the time during which your retirement savings accumulate in a deferred annuity. Because annuities are federal income tax deferred, all earnings are reinvested to increase the base on which future earnings accumulate, so you have the benefit of compounding.When you buy a deferred fixed annuity contract, the company issuing the contract promises a fixed rate of return during the accumulation period regardless of whether market interest rates move up or down. With a deferred variable annuity, the amount you accumulate during the accumulation period depends on the performance of the separate account funds you select from among those offered in the contract, in addition to the rate of interest credited from time to time on any amounts that may have be allocated to the Interest Accumulation Account.At the end of the accumulation period, you can choose to annuitize, agree to some other method of receiving income, or roll over your account value into an immediate annuity. The years in which you receive annuity income are sometimes called the distribution period.     Accumulation unit        Accumulation units are the shares you own in the separate account funds of a variable annuity during the period you're putting money into your annuity. If you own the annuity in a 401(k) plan, each time you make a contribution, that amount is added to one or more of the separate account funds to buy additional accumulation units.The value of your annuity is figured by multiplying the number of units you own by the dollar value of each unit. During the accumulation phase, that value changes to reflect the changing performance of the underlying investments in the separate account funds.     Adjusted gross income (AGI)"", ""Your AGI is your gross, or total, income from taxable sources minus certain deductions. Income includes salary and other employment income, interest and dividends, and long- and short-term capital gains and losses. Deductions include unreimbursed business and medical expenses, contributions to a deductible individual retirement annuity (IRA), and alimony you pay.You figure your AGI on page one of your federal tax return, and it serves as the basis for calculating the income tax you owe. Your modified AGI is used to establish your eligibility for certain tax or financial benefits, such as deducting your IRA contribution or qualifying for certain tax credits.     American depositary shares        When a company based overseas wants to sell its shares in the US markets, it can offer them through a US bank, which is known as the depositary. The depositary bank holds the issuing company's shares, known as American depositary shares (ADSs), and offers them to investors as certificates known as American depositary receipts (ADRs). Each ADR represents a specific number of shares.ADRs are quoted in US dollars and trade on US markets just like ordinary shares. While hundreds are listed on the major exchanges, the majority are traded over the counter, usually because they're too small to meet exchange listing requirements.     Amortization        Amortization is the gradual repayment of a debt over a period of time, such as monthly payments on a mortgage loan or credit card balance. To amortize a loan, your payments must be large enough to pay not only the interest that has accrued but also to reduce the principal you owe.     Annual percentage rate (APR)"", ""A loan's annual percentage rate, or APR, is what credit costs you each year, expressed as a percentage of the loan amount. The APR, which is usually higher than the nominal, or named, rate you're quoted for a loan, includes most of a loan's up-front fees as well as the annual interest rate.\xa0You should use APR, which is a more accurate picture of the cost of borrowing than the interest rate alone, to compare various loans you're considering.     Annuitize        When you annuitize, you choose to convert the assets in your deferred annuity or other retirement savings account into a stream of regular income payments that are guaranteed to last for your lifetime or the combined lifetimes of yourself and another person, called your joint annuitant. You typically annuitize when you retire. But, if you own a nonqualified annuity, you may begin receiving income at 59½ without risking an early withdrawal penalty, or you can postpone the decision to annuitize well beyond normal retirement age.One reason people may give for choosing not to annuitize is that they're afraid if they die shortly after they begin receiving payments, they will forfeit a large portion of the annuity's value. To avoid that situation, some people choose to annuitize with what's called a period certain payout guaranteeing that they or their beneficiaries will receive income for at least a minimum period, typically 5, 10, or 20 years.You should be aware that the promise to pay lifetime income is contingent on the claims-paying ability of the company providing the annuity contract. That's why you'll want to check the ratings that independent analysts give your annuity company before you annuitize your contract.     Annuity"", ""Originally, an annuity simply meant an annual payment. That's why the retirement income you receive from a defined benefit plan each year, usually in monthly installments, is called a pension annuity. But an annuity is also an insurance company product that's designed to allow you to accumulate tax-deferred assets that can be converted to a source of lifetime annual income.When a deferred annuity is offered as part of a qualified plan, such as a traditional 401(k), 403(b), or tax-deferred annuity (TDA), you can contribute up to the annual limit and typically begin to take income from the annuity when you retire. You can also buy a nonqualified deferred annuity contract on your own. With nonqualified annuities, there are no federal limits on annual contributions and no required withdrawals, though you may begin receiving income without penalty when you turn 59½.An immediate annuity, in contrast, is one you purchase with a lump sum when you are ready to begin receiving income, usually when you retire. The payouts begin right away and the annuity company promises the income will last your lifetime.With all types of annuities, the guarantee of lifetime annuity income depends on the claims-paying ability of the company that sells the annuity contract.     Annuity principal        The annuity principal is the sum of money you use to buy an annuity and the base on which annuity earnings accumulate. If you're buying a deferred annuity, you may make a one-time — or single premium — purchase, or you may build your annuity principal with a series of regular or intermittent payments. For example, if you own an annuity in an employer sponsored retirement plan, you add to your principal each time you defer some of your income into your account — typically every time you're paid. When you buy an immediate annuity, you commit your annuity principal as a lump sum, and that amount is one of the key factors that determines the amount of your annuity income.     Appreciation"", ""When an asset such as stock, real estate, or personal property increases in value without any improvements or modification having been made to it, that's called appreciation. Some personal assets, such as fine art or antiques, may appreciate over time, while others - such as electronic equipment - usually lose value, or depreciate. Certain investments also have the potential to appreciate. A number of factors can cause an asset to appreciate, among them inflation, uniqueness, or increased demand.     Asset        Assets are everything you own that has any monetary value, plus any money you are owed. They include money in bank accounts, stocks, bonds, mutual funds, equity in real estate, the value of your life insurance policy, and any personal property that people would pay to own. When you figure your net worth, you subtract the amount you owe, or your liabilities, from your assets. Similarly, a company’s assets include the value of its physical plant, its inventory, and intangible assets, such as its reputation.     Asset allocation"", ""Asset allocation is a strategy, advocated by modern portfolio theory, for reducing risk in your investment portfolio in order to maximize return. Specifically, asset allocation means dividing your assets among different broad categories of investments, called asset classes. Stocks, bonds and cash are examples of asset classes, as are real estate and derivatives such as options and futures contracts.Most financial services firms suggest particular asset allocations for specific groups of clients and fine-tune those allocations for individual investors. The asset allocation model - specifically the percentages of your investment principal allocated to each investment category you're using - that's appropriate for you at any given time depends on many factors, such as the goals you're investing to achieve, how much time you have to invest, your tolerance for risk, the direction of interest rates, and the market outlook.Ideally, you adjust or rebalance your portfolio from time to time to bring the allocation back in line with the model you've selected. Or, you might realign your model as your financial goals, your time frame, or the market situation changes.     Asset class        Different categories of investments are described as asset classes.\xa0 Stocks, bonds, and cash — including cash equivalents — are major asset classes. So are real estate, derivative investments, such as options and futures contracts, and precious metals.When you allocate the assets in your investment portfolio, you decide what proportion of its total value will be invested in each of the different asset classes you're including.                                 © Copyright 1999-2023 Mutual of America Life Insurance Company.

By Joseph Gaffoglio, CFA     It’s been two years since the U.S. economy began to experience a dramatic rise in inflation. Consumers continue to feel its impact, and the outlook for the financial markets and economy remains uncertain. Since the middle of last year, the U.S. Federal Reserve has taken aggressive actions to ease inflation through a steady increase in interest rates. While inflation has declined from its peak levels of last summer, it remains well above the Fed’s target of around 2%. Along with increased borrowing costs across the economy, we have also been affected by bank failures, debt ceiling drama and the ongoing war in Ukraine. So, where does this leave consumers and the markets? \xa0  \xa0 Bank failures lead to tightened lending"", 'In early March, it appeared the Fed was on target to continue its focus on aggressive interest rate hikes and keeping rates higher for a longer period in 2023 to bring down prices by reducing consumer demand. Then, instability hit the banking sector, with the failure of Silicon Valley Bank, a mid-sized bank in California, followed by Signature Bank and First Republic Bank. Across the pond in Europe, UBS took over Swiss rival Credit Suisse Group. With the banking system generally healthier than it was heading into the 2008 financial crisis, and the risk of financial contagion largely in the rearview mirror, focus has turned to a contraction in bank lending, which may put further pressure on the economy. Impact on the financial markets Through the end of May, the S&P 500® Index was up more than 9%, and the bond market was up over 2%. While these advances have been welcome, after the declines in both equity and bond markets last year, we would caution that the equity market has been driven almost entirely by large technology stocks, particularly those tied in some way to artificial intelligence (AI). Broader measures of stock market performance continue to lag, and many investors are still expecting the U.S. economy to slip into recession later this year. Is inflation finally on the decline?  Inflation has eased in recent months, declining from a high of 9% last summer to slightly below 5% for the 12-month period ending in April. While this represents progress, the Fed remains well above its committed target rate of 2% inflation, despite 10 interest rate hikes in the past year.', 'Although lower inflation has provided some relief to consumers, they are still feeling the pinch. The Consumer Price Index declined to 4.9% for April as high prices for some essential services and goods, such as food, finally began to ease. However, these were somewhat offset by increases in prices for gas, used cars and housing, with the latter being one of the largest contributing factors of inflationary pressure. It is expected that the Fed may skip another rate hike at its meeting in mid-June, but remains ready to continue raising rates as needed. Given recent inflation readings, and with the labor market remaining tight, odds are that the Fed could very well be back at it again soon. Stay focused on long-term goals The recent issues in the banking sector are just the latest illustration of why trying to predict the direction of the financial markets based on short-term events is impossible—and can prove costly when making investment decisions. For individuals participating in retirement saving plans, having a long-term investment strategy that aligns with your risk tolerance and time horizon, and continuing to make regular contributions to your portfolio, is the best way to manage through uncertain times and ensure that you stay on the right path toward a financially secure future. \xa0 Joseph Gaffoglio is the President of Mutual of America Capital Management LLC. \xa0 The views expressed in this article are subject to change at any time based on market and other conditions and should not be construed as a recommendation.

The following concepts play an important role in how you prepare financially for retirement."", ""Stocks and bondsStocks, or equities, as they're also called, are shares of ownership in a company. When individuals buy stocks, they become part owner in that company. Bonds, also known as fixed income, are loans that an investor makes to an issuer, such as a company or government. When individuals buy bonds, the borrowers (e.g., companies or governments) pay interest on the loan to investors until it is paid off. Stocks are historically more volatile investments than bonds but have the potential to provide greater returns over the long term, while bonds are generally considered a lower-risk investment but offer lower returns. Investing in bonds still involves risk. Bond prices generally fall when interest rates rise.Regarding your retirement plan, you probably have the option to choose from a menu of investment funds that have been selected by the plan sponsor (usually your employer). These funds invest in underlying stocks and/or bonds (or other securities) in accordance with each fund's Principal Investment Strategies.   Asset allocationAsset allocation is the mix of different types of investment asset classes—such as stocks, bonds and cash—in a portfolio, that can help you meet your objectives and build a financially secure retirement. To determine the asset allocation that's appropriate for you, you'll want to consider a number of factors such as your age, investment goals and tolerance for risk when it comes to investing. For help as you identify the asset allocation that aligns with your long-term investment objectives, check out Mutual of America's Investment Questionnaire."", ""DiversificationDiversification is the strategy of having investments in various asset classes and different types of markets, sectors, industries and securities so your exposure to a single area of the market is limited. Think of the phrase: Don't put all your eggs in one basket. Diversification can further reduce risk and volatility in your retirement account over time, while also helping you with your asset allocation decisions. With a properly diversified portfolio, when one area of the market declines, the rest of your portfolio's value would still be relatively insulated by your investments in other areas. It is important to note that diversification does not guarantee investment returns or eliminate the risk of loss.

In this digital age, you need to be on the lookout for hackers and phishing scammers trying to access your online financial accounts and personal information, including your retirement plan accounts. But there are steps you can take to safeguard your accounts and information. We’ve compiled some tips on how you can protect yourself from cyber theft and move securely toward a financially sound future with peace of mind:   Regularly check your retirement accounts.Part of safeguarding your retirement savings is as simple as checking any accounts you may have. For example, access your retirement savings account periodically to verify that the amount in your account and your personal information—including your name, email and street address—are correct."", 'Use multifactor authentication. As part of Mutual of America’s ongoing commitment to protecting our customers’ accounts and personal information, we have further strengthened the log-in procedures required for access to the My Account section of mutualofamerica.com. Individuals with accounts need to establish multifactor authentication when logging in to My Account. This process only takes a few minutes, and it includes establishing a username and password (if you haven’t already) with at least one of four security factors, which you can choose to receive via the Okta Verify mobile app, text message or email, or by following voice call instructions. Multifactor authentication helps ensure that only you are accessing your online account information. This is one of the ways we ensure that we are adhering to today’s cybersecurity best practices.\xa0 Be savvy with your passwords and internet connection.Make your passwords as strong as possible, don’t use the same passwords across multiple sites, and keep them confidential. Do not share your passwords with anyone. You should also try to avoid public Wi-Fi, as hackers can more easily intercept the passwords you type in—along with any other personal information you enter—when you’re connected to an unsecured internet connection.', ""Be aware of who you’re speaking to. You should not respond to any form of communication from, or provide any personal information to, unverified parties. Be wary of recipients requesting any money or personal information; for example, individuals claiming to be from the IRS have called stimulus check recipients requesting money or personal information, leading (in some cases) to tax-related fraud and identity theft. Your retirement account savings are also vulnerable to these sorts of attacks. A good way to prevent theft is to avoid responding to unsolicited or untrustworthy communications. If you have questions related to protecting your retirement account, please don’t hesitate to contact your local Mutual of America representative.

Before you continue on this page, you should confirm whether the retirement account from which you wish to take a withdrawal or loan, or to which you wish to roll over amounts, is under an employer-sponsored retirement plan or an individual retirement product. You can then navigate to the appropriate section of this page.  For information about taking a withdrawal or loan from an employer-sponsored retirement plan, or making a rollover, please see the first section of this page, “If you have an account under an employer-sponsored plan.”"", 'If you are interested in taking\xa0withdrawal from an individual retirement product, please scroll down toward the bottom of this page, and visit the “If you have an account under an individual retirement product” section. To learn more about Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs), please read our Understanding Required Minimum Distributions article.  \xa0 \xa0    If you have an account under an employer-sponsored plan      You should read the Summary Plan Description that was provided to you as a participant in your employer’s plan to learn whether your employer’s plan allows either withdrawals or loans (or both) and if there are any restrictions imposed by the plan or the IRS on either. If you have questions or are not sure about the features of your employer’s plan, please contact us. As a reminder, your employer established a retirement savings plan to enable and encourage you to save for retirement. Although the plan may contain an in-service withdrawal or loan provision, Mutual of America does not encourage participants to take in-service withdrawals or loans, and your plan savings are not intended to be used for current expenses. When available, in-service withdrawals are generally taxed as ordinary income (and may be assessed a 10% tax penalty if taken before age 59½, or for SIMPLE IRA withdrawals, a 25% tax penalty if taken before age 59½ and within the first two years of participation). And, there are participant charges for loans and loan servicing. There may be significant adverse tax consequences to participants who do not repay loans on a timely basis. Failing to repay loans may have a negative impact on your ability to meet your retirement savings goals. We encourage you to evaluate these issues carefully before requesting a withdrawal or applying for a loan. If you need access to money before you retire, you should carefully consider and exhaust your other options before making a decision to take an in-service withdrawal or loan from your retirement savings.', 'With that, we have provided a general explanation of the difference between a withdrawal and a loan. The provisions of your employer’s plan may be different than the descriptions we provide here. Again, you should read the Summary Plan Description that was provided to you by your employer as a participant in your employer’s plan to learn about the withdrawal and loan provisions, if any, offered through that plan. In-Service Withdrawals from an Employer-Sponsored Plan An in-service withdrawal allows you to take money from your employer’s plan, while you are still employed, without having to pay the money back. Unless the in-service withdrawal is on account of an immediate and heavy financial need (otherwise known as a “hardship distribution”), your plan can not permit in-service distributions of elective deferrals (i.e., the money you have contributed to the plan from your paycheck), or certain other types of contributions, prior to age 59½. If your plan permits in-service withdrawals, you will be able to request a withdrawal of certain employer contributions, any funds you may have rolled over from another plan or IRA and any designated Roth contributions.* You will have to pay ordinary income taxes on a withdrawal amount (unless from your Roth account), and a 10% early withdrawal penalty if you take the withdrawal prior to age 59½, unless an exception applies. *If the Roth distribution does not meet certain rules, earnings will be taxable. Nonqualified Roth distributions must contain pro rata share of earnings and basis.↵ Early Withdrawals from an Employer-Sponsored Plan If you are younger than age 59½ and do not qualify for a\xa0hardship\xa0withdrawal, you will incur an additional 10% income tax penalty, unless an exception applies. See\xa0https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/plan-participant-employee/retirement-topics-tax-on-early-distributions\xa0for applicable exceptions. Hardship Withdrawals from an Employer-Sponsored Plan', 'A hardship withdrawal is made because of an immediate and heavy financial need and is limited to the amount necessary to satisfy that financial need. You pay ordinary income tax on the amount withdrawn and do not have to pay the withdrawal back. You may also have to pay a 10% penalty tax if you are younger than 59½ or do not meet an exception. You are not automatically eligible for a hardship distribution. Your employer must first approve any hardship withdrawal and make sure your request meets the rules under the Internal Revenue Code and Internal Revenue Service regulations. Generally, an immediate and heavy financial need results from:  Medical care expenses for you, your spouse, dependents or beneficiary. Tuition, related educational fees, and room and board expenses for the next 12 months of postsecondary education for you or your spouse, children, dependents or beneficiary. Costs directly related to the purchase of your principal residence (excluding mortgage payments). Payments necessary to prevent the eviction of you from your principal residence or foreclosure on the mortgage on that residence. Certain expenses to repair damage to the employee’s principal residence. Funeral expenses for you, your spouse, children, dependents or beneficiary. Any other expense specified by the Internal Revenue Service.   Did You Know? You can now request rollovers and full or partial withdrawals online! No need to contact a representative via phone.

Contact your Plan Administrator if you need to confirm whether your plan permits hardship withdrawals. Rollovers into an Employer-Sponsored Plan Your employer's plan may accept rollovers from accounts you have with former employers or IRAs with different financial institutions. You may be able to save time, money and effort by transferring your retirement savings from other retirement plans or IRAs into your Mutual of America retirement plan account. You will receive one convenient quarterly statement, and you can manage your account anytime. Before making a rollover or transfer, you should review the accounts you have with other providers to determine the fees and expenses you currently pay and whether there are any surrender charges that may result and to ensure that it is in your best interest to transfer your other accounts to your current retirement plan account. Loans from an Employer-Sponsored Plan A loan enables you to borrow money from your retirement savings and pay it back over time, with interest. Like most loans, you will have to pay interest until the loan is paid back in full; however, the payments and interest will go back into your retirement savings account. In most cases, such as with a 401(k) or 403(b) plan, loans must be paid back within a certain period (usually five years), and in some cases, may require consent from a spouse or partner, depending on your domestic status and plan type. As mentioned previously, there may be significant adverse tax consequences to participants who do not repay loans on a timely basis. Failing to repay loans may have a negative impact on your ability to meet your retirement savings goals."", 'Start a Withdrawal or Rollover from an Employer-Sponsored Plan Group Annuity Retirement Plans Before you initiate a withdrawal or rollover from an employer-sponsored retirement plan that is subject to spousal consent and is funded by a group annuity contract, please complete the following steps:  Review the Summary Plan Description that was provided to you as a participant in your employer’s plan to learn:  Whether your employer’s plan allows for withdrawals or rollovers; If the plan does allow for withdrawals, the type of withdrawals it allows (e.g., in-service or only at termination of employment); and Whether you are eligible for a withdrawal (i.e., you have money in your account that is available for a withdrawal)   Download and read the following document:DOWNLOAD SPECIAL TAX NOTICE 7125 - Financial Information Concerning Qualified Joint & Survivor Annuities and Other Annuity Options To initiate a withdrawal or rollover from a group annuity retirement plan that is subject to spousal consent, download, complete and submit the Withdrawal and Rollover Request Form provided here:\xa0DOWNLOAD WITHDRAWAL AND ROLLOVER REQUESTS (FOR GROUP ANNUITY PLANS ONLY) FORM – 7126  Reminder: This downloadable form is only for use with an employer-sponsored retirement plan that is subject to spousal consent.
